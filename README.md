# AI Capability Framework – Scenario Library

A practical, governance‑credible scenario library for applying the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** in real professional contexts.

This repository translates the Framework from a conceptual model into **actionable, context‑sensitive practice** across education, research, leadership, governance, and knowledge‑intensive work.

---

## Purpose of this repository

This scenario library exists to answer a common gap in AI guidance:

> *“What does responsible, human‑centred AI use actually look like in everyday professional situations?”*

Rather than offering abstract principles or tool‑specific tutorials, this repository provides **structured scenarios** that can be:

* used directly in workshops, meetings, and training
* adapted to local policy, culture, and sector context
* embedded into curriculum, CPD, and governance processes

Each scenario demonstrates **how to think, decide, and reflect** when AI is present — not just how to operate tools.

---

## What these scenarios are

Each scenario is a **facilitation‑ready guide** focused on a specific professional situation (e.g. interviews, curriculum design, risk review meetings, research analysis).

Every scenario:

* follows a consistent structure
* explicitly applies the AI Capability Framework
* treats AI as a *support for human judgement*, not a replacement
* foregrounds ethics, equity, accountability, and learning

Scenarios are written to be:

* realistic
* institution‑ready
* usable by non‑technical professionals

---

## What these scenarios are not

These scenarios are **not**:

* tool tutorials or prompts collections
* technical AI implementation guides
* organisational policy documents
* generic “best practice” checklists

They are designed to **sit between policy and practice**, supporting responsible action in real situations.

## The AI Capability Framework (reference model)

All scenarios apply the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** across six domains:

1. **Awareness** – understanding context, purpose, and risk
2. **Human–AI Co‑Agency** – clear roles and responsibility
3. **Applied Practice** – appropriate, proportionate use
4. **Ethics, Equity & Impact** – consequences and inclusion
5. **Decision‑Making & Governance** – accountability and oversight
6. **Reflection, Learning & Renewal** – continuous improvement

The Framework is treated as **the canonical reference model**. Scenarios demonstrate how it operates in practice.

## How to use this library

A recommended usage pattern:

1. **Select** a scenario aligned to your context
2. **Adapt** language, examples, and prompts to local needs
3. **Use** the structure to facilitate discussion or design work
4. **Capture learning** using the reflection sections
5. **Iterate** and version your adapted scenario

Scenarios may be used:

## Relationship to other CloudPedagogy resources

This repository complements (but does not duplicate):

* the **AI Capability Framework (canonical model)**
* the **AI Capability Briefs** repository (conceptual topic explainers)
* CloudPedagogy courses and handbooks

Briefs explain *what* and *why*.

Scenarios show *how*.
