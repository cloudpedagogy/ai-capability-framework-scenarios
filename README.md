# AI Capability Framework — Scenario Library

A practical, governance-credible scenario library for applying the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** in real professional contexts.

This repository translates the Framework from a conceptual reference model into **actionable, context-sensitive practice** across education, research, leadership, governance, public service, and knowledge-intensive work.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This Scenario Library exists to address a persistent gap in AI guidance:

> *What does responsible, human-centred AI use actually look like in everyday professional situations?*

Rather than offering abstract principles, tool tutorials, or policy statements, this repository provides **structured, facilitation-ready scenarios** that can be:

- used directly in workshops, meetings, and training  
- adapted to local policy, culture, and sector context  
- embedded into curriculum, CPD, governance, and assurance processes  

Each scenario focuses on **how people think, decide, and exercise judgement** when AI is present — not simply how tools are used.

---

## What These Scenarios Are

Each scenario is a **contextual guide** focused on a specific professional situation (for example: assessment design, incident response, curriculum workshops, public consultation, or research analysis).

Every scenario:

- follows a consistent structure  
- explicitly applies all six domains of the AI Capability Framework  
- treats AI as a *support for human judgement*, not a substitute  
- foregrounds ethics, equity, accountability, and learning  

Scenarios are written to be:

- realistic and recognisable  
- institution-ready  
- usable by non-technical professionals  

---

## What These Scenarios Are Not

These scenarios are **not**:

- tool tutorials or prompt collections  
- technical AI implementation guides  
- organisational policy documents  
- generic “best practice” checklists  

They are designed to sit **between policy and practice**, supporting defensible action in real situations where judgement matters.

---

## The AI Capability Framework (Reference Model)

All scenarios apply the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** across six domains:

1. **Awareness** — understanding context, purpose, and risk  
2. **Human–AI Co-Agency** — clear roles and responsibility  
3. **Applied Practice** — appropriate, proportionate use  
4. **Ethics, Equity & Impact** — consequences and inclusion  
5. **Decision-Making & Governance** — accountability and oversight  
6. **Reflection, Learning & Renewal** — continuous improvement  

The Framework functions as the **canonical reference model**.  
Scenarios demonstrate how it operates in practice.
