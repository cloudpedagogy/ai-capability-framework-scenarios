# Assessment, Evaluation, and Quality Judgement — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on assessment, evaluation, and quality judgement in education and research contexts.

Assessment is the point where AI use most directly affects outcomes, legitimacy, and trust. Decisions made here influence progression, awards, credibility, and institutional accountability. As a result, this is one of the highest-risk and highest-impact domains for AI use.

These scenarios are designed to support responsible, defensible decision-making where AI may be present — without undermining academic judgement, fairness, or quality assurance.

## Who this set is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Academic staff involved in assessment design and marking  
- Programme leaders and assessment leads  
- External examiners and reviewers  
- Quality assurance and academic governance teams  
- Professional services staff supporting assessment and integrity processes  

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Structured, facilitation-ready guides  
- Grounded in realistic academic and institutional contexts  
- Explicitly aligned to all six domains of the AI Capability Framework  
- Suitable for individual reflection, team discussion, and formal review settings  

### These scenarios are not:

- Technical marking automation guides  
- Tool-specific AI instructions  
- Policy documents or compliance checklists  
- Shortcuts for judgement, moderation, or accountability  

They are designed to sit **between policy and practice**, supporting thoughtful, human-centred decisions where AI may influence assessment processes.

## How to use this set

A recommended approach:

1. Select the scenario most aligned to your assessment context  
2. Read the situation and risk framing carefully  
3. Work through the six Framework domains collaboratively  
4. Use AI selectively to support reflection or organisation — not judgement  
5. Capture decisions, rationales, and learning explicitly  
6. Revisit and adapt practices over time  

These scenarios pair well with:
- student-facing activity design
- assessment integrity guidance
- programme-level quality review
