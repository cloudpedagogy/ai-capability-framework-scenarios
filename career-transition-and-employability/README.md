# Career Transition and Employability — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on career disruption, employability, and professional transition.

The scenarios are designed to support reflective, responsible, and credible use of generative AI during moments of career change — without hype, misrepresentation, or over-automation.

They foreground judgement, ethics, and capability articulation rather than optimisation or output volume.

---

## Who This Is For

These scenarios are intended for:

- Individuals navigating redundancy, job loss, or career change  
- Professionals preparing for interviews where AI capability may be discussed  
- Career coaches, employability teams, and mentors supporting job seekers  
- Educators and CPD designers developing AI-aware employability support  

---

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios **are**:

- Written, self-contained scenario documents (Markdown)
- Hypothetical but realistic cases designed to support reflection and preparation
- Explicitly mapped to all six domains of the AI Capability Framework
- Suitable for independent use, workshops, coaching, or guided discussion

### These scenarios **are not**:

- A promise of employment or interview success
- A collection of “automation hacks” for mass-producing applications
- Guidance to fabricate, exaggerate, or misrepresent experience
- Templates for delegating career judgement to AI tools

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended approach:

1. Open the scenario most relevant to your current situation  
2. Engage with the narrative and reflection prompts  
3. Work through the six framework domains at your own pace  
4. Use generative AI selectively to support thinking, clarification, or rehearsal  
5. Articulate your own ethical boundaries and decision rules  
6. Revisit and refine your approach after applications, interviews, or feedback  

The scenarios are intentionally self-contained and do not require additional tooling.

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

Some topics may appear adjacent to recruitment-related themes (for example, interviews). The distinction is intentional:

- This folder focuses on the **individual experience** of career transition, confidence rebuilding, ethical self-use of AI, and capability articulation  
- Recruitment-focused folders address **institutional and process-level** concerns such as selection, assessment, governance, and decision-making
