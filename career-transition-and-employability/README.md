# Career Transition and Employability — Scenario Set

This folder contains **PDF-based scenario applications** of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on **career disruption, job search, employability, and professional repositioning**.

These scenarios are designed to help individuals use generative AI **responsibly, credibly, and reflectively** during career transition — without hype, misrepresentation, or over-automation.

## Who this is for

- Individuals navigating redundancy, job loss, or career change  
- Professionals preparing for interviews where AI capability may be discussed  
- Career coaches, employability teams, and mentors supporting job seekers  
- Educators and CPD designers developing AI-aware employability support  

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

These scenarios **are**:
- Structured, printable **PDF resources**
- Hypothetical but realistic cases to support reflection and preparation
- Explicitly mapped to all six domains of the AI Capability Framework
- Suitable for independent use, workshops, or guided discussion

These scenarios are **not**:
- A promise of employment outcomes
- A set of “automation hacks” for mass-producing applications
- Guidance to fabricate, exaggerate, or misrepresent experience

## How to use this set

A recommended approach:

1. Open and read the scenario PDF relevant to your situation  
2. Engage with the narrative and reflection prompts  
3. Work through the six framework domains at your own pace  
4. Use generative AI selectively to support thinking, clarification, or rehearsal  
5. Record your own ethical boundaries and decision rules  
6. Revisit and refine your approach after applications or interviews  

The PDFs are intentionally self-contained and do not require additional tooling.

## Relationship to other scenario folders

Some topics may appear adjacent to recruitment themes (for example, interviews). The distinction is intentional:

- **This folder** focuses on the *individual experience* of career transition, confidence rebuilding, ethical self-use of AI, and capability articulation  
- Recruitment-focused scenario folders address *institutional and process-level* concerns such as selection, assessment, and governance
