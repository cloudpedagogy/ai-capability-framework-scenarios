# Scenario 01 — Redundancy and Reframing

**Scenario category:** Career Transition and Employability  
**Framework:** CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)  
**Licence:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## Scenario overview

This scenario explores how a professional who has experienced redundancy can use generative AI responsibly and reflectively to regain clarity, reframe their experience, and prepare for re-entry into the labour market.

The focus is not on automating job applications, but on developing **credible AI capability**: how a person thinks, decides, reflects, and works with AI under uncertainty.

The scenario is written as a hypothetical but realistic case and can be adapted across sectors including higher education, research, public services, healthcare, NGOs, and professional services.

## Context narrative

You have recently been made redundant following organisational restructuring. The role you held for several years no longer exists. While you have strong experience and professional values, the labour market now feels unstable and increasingly shaped by AI-related expectations.

You are not trying to become an “AI expert”. Instead, you want to:

- Understand how AI is affecting roles in your field  
- Re-articulate your experience in a way that feels honest and future-ready  
- Prepare for interviews where AI capability, ethics, and judgement may be discussed  
- Avoid panic-driven or unethical use of AI tools  

You decide to treat generative AI as a thinking partner, guided by the AI Capability Framework.

## Applying the AI Capability Framework

### Domain 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Regain orientation without overwhelm.

You begin by using AI to help you understand where AI actually matters in your sector — and where it does not. Rather than asking *“What AI tools should I learn?”*, you focus on:

- How AI is being discussed in job descriptions  
- Which responsibilities are changing versus staying stable  
- Where human judgement is still central  

**Example reflective prompt:**

> *“Based on current job listings in my field, where is AI mentioned explicitly, implicitly, or not at all? What does this suggest about expectations rather than tools?”*

This helps you avoid unnecessary upskilling and reduces anxiety driven by hype.

### Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency

**Purpose in this scenario:** Reclaim agency after job loss.

Redundancy can undermine confidence. You use AI not to replace your thinking, but to surface it:

- Clarifying what decisions you used to own  
- Identifying where judgement, ethics, and contextual awareness mattered  
- Distinguishing between automation and responsibility  

**Example co-agency prompt:**

> *“Help me describe situations in my previous role where I used professional judgement alongside tools, systems, or data — without overstating automation or AI.”*

This supports narrative rebuilding without exaggeration.

---

### Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Use AI practically, but with restraint.

You apply AI to:

- Re-structure your CV language (not fabricate content)  
- Map experience to selection criteria  
- Generate interview practice questions based on real role descriptions  

You explicitly avoid:

- Auto-generated CVs without review  
- Inflated claims of AI expertise  
- Submitting AI-generated text you do not understand  

**Example applied prompt:**

> *“Rewrite this CV section to emphasise transferable capabilities and outcomes, keeping all facts accurate and verifiable.”*

---

### Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact

**Purpose in this scenario:** Avoid hidden risks.

You reflect on:

- Fairness in AI-assisted job applications  
- Transparency if asked about AI use  
- Bias amplification in recruitment tools  

You decide on personal boundaries, such as:

- Never fabricating experience  
- Being honest if AI supported preparation  
- Ensuring accessibility and inclusion are not undermined  

**Reflection question:**

> *“If I were the hiring manager, what AI-related behaviours would build or reduce trust?”*

---

### Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance

**Purpose in this scenario:** Prepare for credibility-based interviews.

Many employers now ask questions such as:

- “How do you use AI responsibly?”  
- “Where would you not use AI?”  

You use the framework to prepare structured answers that demonstrate:

- Risk awareness  
- Accountability  
- Clear boundaries  

**Example governance prompt:**

> *“Help me prepare a concise interview answer explaining how I decide when AI is appropriate, when human oversight is essential, and how I manage risk.”*

---

### Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal

**Purpose in this scenario:** Turn disruption into renewal.

You use AI for guided reflection rather than productivity pressure:

- Identifying learning priorities  
- Recognising the emotional impact of redundancy  
- Setting a sustainable pace for re-entry  

**Reflection prompt:**

> *“What have I learned about my professional values during this transition, and how can AI support — rather than distort — that learning?”*

This reframes job loss as a transition, not a failure.

---

## Cross-domain synthesis

Across all six domains, the key shift is this:

**From using AI to get a job faster → to using AI to present credible, ethical, and future-ready professional capability.**

The framework helps job seekers:

- Speak confidently without hype  
- Demonstrate judgement rather than tools  
- Align with employer concerns around trust and responsibility  

---

## Adaptation notes

This scenario can be adapted for:

- Early-career professionals  
- Mid-career redundancy  
- Academic or research roles  
- Public-sector transitions  
- Career coaching or employability workshops  

Facilitators may shorten or expand sections depending on context.
