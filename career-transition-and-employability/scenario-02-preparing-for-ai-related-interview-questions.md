## Scenario overview

This scenario focuses on how a job applicant can prepare for AI-related interview questions using the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework. The emphasis is on developing credible, trustworthy responses that demonstrate judgement, ethics, and human–AI collaboration — rather than overstating technical expertise or relying on rehearsed buzzwords.

The scenario is suitable for roles where AI awareness is now implicitly or explicitly expected, including education, research, public services, healthcare, NGOs, policy, and professional services.

## Context narrative

You have progressed to interview stage for a role that aligns well with your experience. During the recruitment process, you notice that:

- The job description references AI, digital transformation, or innovation  
- The organisation signals interest in responsible or ethical use of technology  
- You are unsure how deeply they expect AI knowledge, but you anticipate questions  

You are concerned about two things:

- Sounding uninformed or outdated  
- Overselling AI expertise in a way that feels dishonest  

You decide to prepare using the AI Capability Framework to develop balanced, role-appropriate answers.

## Applying the AI Capability Framework

### Domain 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Establish realistic expectations.

You begin by clarifying what type of AI understanding is relevant for the role. Rather than learning tools at random, you use AI to analyse:

- The organisation’s public statements about AI  
- Sector-specific AI risks and opportunities  
- Likely interview question themes (e.g. risk, quality, efficiency, ethics)  

**Example orientation prompt:**

> *“Based on this job description and organisation profile, what kinds of AI-related interview questions are most likely, and what level of depth would be appropriate?”*

This avoids both under- and over-preparation.

---

### Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency

**Purpose in this scenario:** Frame yourself as a thoughtful human decision-maker.

You prepare to explain how you work with AI rather than being replaced by it. You focus on:

- Where AI supports thinking, drafting, or analysis  
- Where you retain responsibility and judgement  
- How you check, challenge, or contextualise AI outputs  

**Example co-agency prompt:**

> *“Help me articulate how I use AI as a support for analysis and preparation, while remaining accountable for decisions and outcomes.”*

This positions you as safe and reflective rather than tool-dependent.

---

### Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Prepare concrete examples.

Interviewers often prefer examples over theory. You use AI to help structure:

- Short STAR-style responses involving AI-supported work  
- Hypothetical scenarios relevant to the role  
- Explanations of learning or experimentation without exaggeration  

**Example applied prompt:**

> *“Based on my experience, help me draft a concise interview example showing how AI supported my work, including what I did and what I checked myself.”*

You review and refine all outputs manually.

---

### Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact

**Purpose in this scenario:** Demonstrate ethical maturity.

You anticipate questions such as:

- “What are the risks of using AI in this role?”  
- “How do you ensure fairness or inclusion?”  

You prepare answers that reference:

- Bias and data quality  
- Transparency with stakeholders  
- Impact on colleagues, students, or service users  

**Reflection prompt:**

> *“What ethical risks would matter most to this organisation, and how would I recognise and respond to them in practice?”*

---

### Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance

**Purpose in this scenario:** Signal trustworthiness.

You prepare to discuss:

- When not to use AI  
- Escalation and oversight  
- Accountability boundaries  

You avoid vague statements like *“AI improves efficiency”* and instead show how decisions are made.

**Example governance prompt:**

> *“Help me prepare an interview answer explaining how I decide whether AI use is appropriate, who is accountable, and how risks are managed.”*

---

### Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal

**Purpose in this scenario:** Show learning mindset.

You prepare to discuss:

- How you keep learning about AI responsibly  
- How you adapt without chasing trends  
- How reflection informs improvement  

**Reflection prompt:**

> *“How can I communicate that I am actively learning about AI without overstating expertise or relying on buzzwords?”*

This reassures interviewers that you are adaptable and self-aware.

---

## Cross-domain synthesis

Across the six domains, interview preparation shifts from:

**“Proving I know AI tools” → “Demonstrating I can work responsibly with AI in this role.”**

The framework helps candidates:

- Answer AI-related questions calmly  
- Demonstrate judgement and boundaries  
- Align with organisational risk and trust concerns  

---

## Adaptation notes

This scenario can be adapted for:

- Panel interviews  
- Academic or research appointments  
- Public-sector recruitment  
- Senior leadership roles  
- Career coaching workshops  

Facilitators may role-play interviewer questions using the domains.
