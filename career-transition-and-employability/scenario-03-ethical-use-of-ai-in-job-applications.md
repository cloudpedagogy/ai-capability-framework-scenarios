## Scenario overview

This scenario addresses the ethical boundaries of using generative AI during job applications. It helps candidates navigate CV writing, cover letters, application forms, and declarations with integrity, transparency, and confidence.

Rather than prohibiting AI use or encouraging unchecked automation, the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework provides a principled middle ground: AI as support for thinking and clarity, with human accountability retained throughout.

---

## Context narrative

You are actively applying for roles and notice that:

- Some organisations explicitly discourage AI-generated applications  
- Others say nothing, but expect originality and honesty  
- You see online advice encouraging full automation of CVs and cover letters  

You want to use AI to support your applications without crossing ethical lines or undermining trust. You also want to be prepared if asked about AI use during recruitment.

You decide to define clear personal boundaries using the AI Capability Framework.

## Applying the AI Capability Framework

### Domain 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Understand norms and expectations.

You begin by clarifying:

- Sector-specific expectations around AI use  
- Whether the employer has published guidance  
- How AI-assisted writing is perceived in your field  

You use AI to analyse publicly available recruitment policies and infer expectations.

**Example orientation prompt:**

> *“Based on this organisation’s values and recruitment guidance, what ethical expectations are likely regarding AI use in applications?”*

---

### Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency

**Purpose in this scenario:** Maintain authorship and ownership.

You establish that:

- You remain the author of all submitted materials  
- AI may support structure, clarity, or reflection  
- Final decisions and wording are yours  

**Example co-agency prompt:**

> *“Help me clarify my ideas for this cover letter while ensuring the final voice and content remain mine.”*

You review every output critically.

---

### Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Use AI practically without misrepresentation.

You define acceptable uses of AI, such as:

- Improving clarity and structure  
- Mapping experience to criteria  
- Identifying gaps or redundancies  

You avoid:

- Fabricating achievements  
- Inflating responsibilities  
- Submitting AI-generated text without understanding it  

**Example applied prompt:**

> *“Review this draft cover letter and suggest clarity improvements without changing factual content.”*

---

### Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact

**Purpose in this scenario:** Consider fairness and trust.

You reflect on:

- Whether AI use creates unfair advantage  
- Accessibility considerations  
- Bias embedded in language models  

You decide that ethical use includes:

- Transparency if asked  
- Respect for inclusive recruitment practices  
- Avoiding deceptive optimisation  

**Reflection question:**

> *“Would I feel comfortable explaining how I used AI in this application to the hiring panel?”*

---

### Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance

**Purpose in this scenario:** Set personal governance rules.

You create a simple decision framework:

- What AI can support  
- What must remain human-written  
- When to stop using AI  

**Example governance prompt:**

> *“Help me draft a personal policy for ethical AI use in job applications that I can follow consistently.”*

This ensures repeatable, defensible behaviour.

---

### Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal

**Purpose in this scenario:** Learn from each application cycle.

After each submission, you reflect:

- Did AI use improve clarity without distortion?  
- Did the process align with your values?  
- What would you adjust next time?  

**Reflection prompt:**

> *“What did this application teach me about my boundaries and responsible AI use?”*

---

## Cross-domain synthesis

Across the framework, ethical AI use in job applications is framed as:

**Supportive, transparent, accountable — never deceptive or substitutive.**

The framework helps candidates:

- Maintain integrity  
- Reduce anxiety about “getting it wrong”  
- Build trust before the first interview  

---

## Adaptation notes

This scenario can be adapted for:

- Academic and research applications  
- Public-sector recruitment  
- Early-career graduates  
- Career-transition workshops  

It may also support institutional guidance development.
