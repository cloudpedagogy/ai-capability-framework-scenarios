## Scenario overview

This scenario supports professionals who are transitioning into AI-adjacent roles — positions where AI influences workflows, decision-making, or strategy, but where the role holder is not expected to be a technical AI specialist.

The focus is on credible repositioning: articulating human judgement, domain expertise, ethical awareness, and responsible collaboration with AI systems without overstating technical capability.

---

## Context narrative

You are considering roles that reference AI more explicitly than your previous position. Examples include:

- Digital or transformation-focused roles  
- AI-enabled teaching, research, policy, or service roles  
- Programme, product, or operations roles with AI exposure  

You are confident in your professional experience but concerned about:

- Over-claiming AI expertise  
- Being dismissed as “not technical enough”  
- Sounding vague or generic when discussing AI  

You decide to use the AI Capability Framework to reframe your profile around capability rather than tools.

## Applying the AI Capability Framework

### Domain 1 — AI Awareness & Orientation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Understand what “AI-adjacent” really means.

You begin by clarifying:

- Which parts of the role involve AI systems  
- Where decision-making, interpretation, and governance sit  
- What technical depth is actually required  

**Example orientation prompt:**

> *“Based on this role description, what aspects are AI-enabled versus human-led, and where is judgement most critical?”*

This prevents unnecessary technical overreach.

---

### Domain 2 — Human–AI Co-Agency

**Purpose in this scenario:** Position yourself as a capable collaborator.

You focus on:

- How you frame problems for AI tools  
- How you evaluate and contextualise outputs  
- How you work with technical colleagues  

**Example co-agency prompt:**

> *“Help me articulate how I collaborate with AI systems and technical specialists while retaining responsibility for outcomes.”*

This signals maturity and teamwork.

---

### Domain 3 — Applied Practice & Innovation

**Purpose in this scenario:** Show relevant, honest practice.

You prepare examples of:

- Using AI to support analysis, synthesis, or communication  
- Piloting tools cautiously  
- Translating AI outputs into action  

You avoid claiming:

- Model development  
- Algorithm design  
- Technical ownership you do not have  

**Example applied prompt:**

> *“Help me frame an example where AI supported my work, clearly distinguishing between what AI did and what I decided.”*

---

### Domain 4 — Ethics, Equity & Impact

**Purpose in this scenario:** Address organisational concerns.

You prepare to discuss:

- Risks of inappropriate AI use  
- Bias and exclusion  
- Impact on users, learners, or staff  

**Reflection question:**

> *“What ethical risks would I be expected to notice and escalate in this role?”*

This aligns you with institutional values.

---

### Domain 5 — Decision-Making & Governance

**Purpose in this scenario:** Demonstrate reliability.

You articulate:

- When AI outputs require human review  
- How decisions are documented  
- How accountability is maintained  

**Example governance prompt:**

> *“Help me prepare an explanation of how I would manage AI-related decisions responsibly in this role.”*

This reassures employers.

---

### Domain 6 — Reflection, Learning & Renewal

**Purpose in this scenario:** Signal sustainable growth.

You describe:

- How you stay informed without chasing hype  
- How reflection guides learning priorities  
- How you adapt as AI evolves  

**Reflection prompt:**

> *“How can I show that I am developing AI capability responsibly over time rather than claiming fixed expertise?”*

---

## Cross-domain synthesis

Across all domains, moving into AI-adjacent roles becomes:

**A shift from technical performance to responsible capability.**

The framework enables candidates to:

- Avoid false expertise claims  
- Communicate value clearly  
- Align with organisational trust and risk priorities  

---

## Adaptation notes

This scenario can be adapted for:

- Mid-career transitions  
- Academic leadership roles  
- Professional services  
- Public-sector and NGO contexts  

It can also support mentoring and career-coaching programmes.
