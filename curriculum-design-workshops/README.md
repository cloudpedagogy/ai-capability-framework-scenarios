# Curriculum Design Workshops — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on curriculum design, educational development, and teaching-related professional practice.

The scenarios are designed for contexts where educators, learning designers, and institutions are making consequential decisions about learning outcomes, assessment, pedagogy, and student experience — often with generative AI present, proposed, or contested.

They emphasise pedagogical judgement, collective sensemaking, and ethical design rather than tool adoption or automation.

## What This Scenario Set Covers

The scenarios in this folder address AI use across the full lifecycle of curriculum and teaching-related work, including:

- Designing and revising curricula and programmes  
- Facilitating curriculum design workshops and co-design sessions  
- Developing staff capability through CPD and training  
- Designing student-facing learning activities with explicit AI expectations  
- Conducting reflective debriefs to consolidate learning and improve practice  

Each scenario applies the six domains of the AI Capability Framework to real, decision-bearing educational contexts.

## Who These Scenarios Are For

These scenarios are intended for:

- Academic staff and programme leaders  
- Learning designers and educational developers  
- Educational leadership teams and curriculum committees  
- CPD facilitators and staff development leads  
- Educators designing AI-aware learning activities  

They are suitable for individual reflection, facilitated workshops, curriculum review processes, and professional development settings.

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios **are**:

- Written, self-contained scenario documents (Markdown)
- Grounded in realistic educational practice and institutional constraints
- Explicitly aligned to all six AI Capability Framework domains
- Designed to support discussion, reflection, and defensible decision-making

### These scenarios **are not**:

- Prescriptive curriculum templates
- Tool-specific guides or product recommendations
- Automation shortcuts for curriculum or assessment design
- Compliance checklists divorced from pedagogical context

## How to Use This Folder

A recommended approach:

1. Select the scenario relevant to your current activity (design, teaching, CPD, or review)
2. Read the scenario individually or with colleagues
3. Use the prompts and questions to structure discussion
4. Apply the six framework domains to your local context
5. Document decisions, tensions, and learning for future cycles
6. Revisit scenarios as practices, tools, or policies evolve

These scenarios can be used alongside the reusable templates in the `/templates` folder (e.g. Pre-Activity AI Briefs, In-Activity Prompt Cards, Post-Activity Reflection).

## Relationship to Other Scenario Sets

This folder focuses on **educational design and teaching practice**.

Related but distinct scenario sets include:

- `/governance-and-decision-making` — approval, QA, and institutional oversight  
- `/meetings-and-collaboration` — facilitation, decision capture, and follow-up  
- `/research-and-knowledge-work` — analysis, interpretation, and dissemination  
- `/interviews-and-recruitment` — hiring and selection processes  

The separation supports clearer navigation and more defensible application in institutional contexts.
