# Student-Facing Activities — Applying the AI Capability Framework

**Framework:** CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)  
**Licence:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports learning activities designed for students where generative AI may be available, encouraged, constrained, or explicitly prohibited. It focuses on designing activities that promote learning, integrity, and capability — not simply task completion.

Student-facing activities are where institutional intentions about AI become experienced realities. Poorly designed activities can encourage over-reliance, surface inequities, or undermine assessment integrity. Well-designed activities can build confidence, critical judgement, and ethical AI capability.

The purpose of this scenario is to help educators design student-facing activities that make AI use visible, intentional, and pedagogically meaningful, while protecting academic standards and learner trust.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Academic staff and tutors  
- Learning designers and educational developers  
- Programme leaders and assessment leads  
- Staff supporting academic integrity and student success  

---

## 2. Situation and Context

A student-facing activity is being designed or revised. It may involve:

- formative or summative tasks  
- individual or group work  
- in-class, online, or blended formats  

Constraints and pressures often include:

- uncertainty about appropriate AI use  
- diverse student access, confidence, and experience  
- concerns about plagiarism or misconduct  

AI may be available to students informally or formally. How the activity is designed will determine whether AI use supports learning or distorts it.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

Students may use AI in activities to:

- brainstorm ideas or structure work  
- clarify concepts or language  
- generate drafts or examples  
- support reflection or feedback  

These uses matter because:

- AI can mask gaps in understanding  
- uneven access can exacerbate inequity  
- unclear boundaries create anxiety or misconduct risk  

This scenario treats AI use in student-facing activities as **medium- to high-risk**, depending on assessment stakes.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before designing the activity, clarify:

- what learning the activity is intended to develop  
- what evidence of learning is required  
- how AI might help or hinder that learning  

Key awareness questions:

- What must students genuinely understand or be able to do?  
- Where is AI use acceptable, limited, or inappropriate?  
- What assumptions are we making about student access or skill?  

AI should be positioned to support learning, not replace it.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In student-facing activities:

- students remain accountable for learning and outputs  
- AI may be used as a tool, not an author or substitute  

Good co-agency means:

- students are guided on how to use AI responsibly  
- reflective commentary on AI use is encouraged or required  
- educators retain responsibility for task design and judgement  

Avoid:

- ambiguous guidance that leaves students guessing  
- activities that reward uncritical AI output  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI-supported activity designs include:

- tasks that require critique, adaptation, or comparison of AI outputs  
- activities that foreground process over product  
- structured prompts that make AI use explicit  

Inappropriate designs include:

- tasks easily completed through direct AI generation  
- activities where AI use is hidden but inevitable  
- assessments that cannot distinguish learning from delegation  

AI should be integrated by design, not by assumption.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity and Impact

Student-facing activities raise equity concerns.

Use the Framework to ask:

- Do all students have comparable access and support?  
- Are we advantaging confidence or familiarity with AI tools?  
- How are academic integrity and fairness being protected?  

Ethical design promotes transparency, inclusion, and trust.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making and Governance

Good governance includes:

- clear statements about permitted and prohibited AI use  
- alignment with assessment regulations and integrity policies  
- consistency across modules and programmes  

If AI is permitted:

- articulate expectations clearly to students  
- explain how AI use will be considered in marking  
- avoid hidden or inconsistent rules  

This supports defensibility and student confidence.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning and Renewal

After running the activity, reflect:

- Did students understand expectations around AI use?  
- Where did AI enhance or distort learning?  
- What should change next time?  

Reflection helps evolve AI-aware pedagogy, not just compliance.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts and Checks

### Educator reflection prompts

- What learning evidence would convince us this activity worked?  
- Where might students misuse AI unintentionally?  
- Are we modelling the behaviour we expect?  

### Optional AI prompts (for student use)

- “Generate an initial outline, then critique its assumptions and limitations.”  
- “Explain this concept, then identify what the explanation misses.”  

### Pause and check

- Would students describe this task as fair and clear?  
- Is AI use visible rather than hidden?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

After the activity, consider:

- How did students actually use AI?  
- Where were misunderstandings or anxieties evident?  
- What guidance needs refinement?  

Use insights to improve future activity design and guidance.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations to:

- design student activities that build AI capability, not dependence  
- reduce misconduct through clarity and design  
- support equitable and ethical learning experiences  
- align pedagogy with assessment integrity  
- embed the AI Capability Framework into everyday teaching practice
