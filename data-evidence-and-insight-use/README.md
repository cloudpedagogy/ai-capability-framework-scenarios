# Data, Evidence, and Insight Use — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on how organisations interpret, trust, and act on AI-mediated data, evidence, and insights.

As AI increasingly shapes dashboards, reports, analytics, and performance narratives, the core challenge is no longer data availability — but **judgement**. Decisions are often made on the basis of AI-processed evidence that appears objective, authoritative, or predictive, even when uncertainty, bias, or proxy reasoning is present.

These scenarios support reflective, defensible use of AI in evidence interpretation — helping teams avoid false certainty, automation bias, and unexamined assumptions.

## Why this folder matters

AI is now deeply embedded in:

- dashboards and performance reporting  
- analytics and evidence synthesis  
- predictive and early-warning systems  
- strategic and operational decision support  

However, most AI guidance focuses on *tools* rather than on **how evidence is interpreted and legitimised**.

This folder addresses a critical gap:
- how organisations decide *what counts as evidence*
- how insight is translated into action
- how uncertainty, bias, and limitation are surfaced rather than hidden

---

## Who this set is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Senior leaders and decision-makers  
- Strategy, planning, and performance teams  
- Analysts, researchers, and insight functions  
- Governance, assurance, and audit groups  
- Public-sector, education, and research organisations  

They are suitable for both **strategic and operational** contexts.

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Facilitation-ready, context-rich guides  
- Grounded in real organisational practices  
- Explicitly aligned to all six AI Capability Framework domains  
- Designed for reflection, discussion, and decision support  

### These scenarios are not:

- Technical analytics or data science guides  
- Tool-specific dashboard tutorials  
- Data governance or compliance manuals  
- Automated decision-making workflows  

They are intended to sit **between data production and decision authority**.

## How to use this set

A recommended approach:

1. Select a scenario aligned to your evidence or insight context  
2. Clarify what data or AI outputs are in play  
3. Work through the six Framework domains collaboratively  
4. Use AI only to support sensemaking, not judgement  
5. Capture assumptions, limits, and trade-offs explicitly  
6. Revisit decisions as conditions or data change  

These scenarios pair well with:

- governance and decision-making scenarios  
- leadership and strategy discussions  
- assessment, evaluation, and quality judgement contexts

## Scenarios in this folder

- **Dashboard Interpretation and Reporting**  
- **Evidence Synthesis for Decision-Making**  
- **KPI Review and Performance Narratives**  
- **Predictive Insight and Early Warning Systems**  
- **Translating Data into Action**

---

## Framework reference

All scenarios apply the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** across six domains:

1. Awareness  
2. Human–AI Co-Agency  
3. Applied Practice  
4. Ethics, Equity & Impact  
5. Decision-Making & Governance  
6. Reflection, Learning & Renewal  

Each scenario demonstrates how epistemic judgement, accountability, and learning are maintained when AI shapes evidence and insight.
