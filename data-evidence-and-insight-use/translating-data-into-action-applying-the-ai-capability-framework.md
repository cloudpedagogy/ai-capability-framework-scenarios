# Translating Data into Action: Applying the AI Capability Framework

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports moments where AI-mediated data, insights, or analysis are translated into **decisions, actions, or interventions**. This is the point at which information becomes consequential.

Across organisations, dashboards, reports, models, and summaries increasingly inform choices about funding, staffing, support, strategy, compliance, and performance. AI often plays a role in shaping what is seen as salient, urgent, or actionable. The risk at this stage is not data error alone, but **misinterpretation, overconfidence, and premature action**.

The purpose of this scenario is to help teams ensure that AI-informed data leads to **responsible, proportionate, and accountable action**, with human judgement clearly in control.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Senior leaders and managers
- Strategy, planning, and performance teams
- Governance and assurance bodies
- Programme and service leads
- Professionals responsible for acting on insights

## 2. Situation & Context

An organisation has reviewed data or analysis — often AI-assisted — and is considering next steps. This may involve:
- acting on performance trends
- intervening in perceived risk
- reallocating resources
- changing priorities or strategy
- escalating issues for governance attention

Common pressures include:
- expectation to “do something” with the data
- time constraints and decision fatigue
- reputational or regulatory risk
- fear of appearing inactive or unresponsive

At this point, AI may be framed as providing *evidence for action*. Whether that action is justified, proportionate, and fair requires careful judgement.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used to:
- recommend actions or interventions
- prioritise issues or cases
- generate action plans or options
- simulate likely outcomes
- justify decisions through data narratives

These uses matter because:
- recommendations may encode hidden values
- prioritisation can marginalise certain groups
- action plans may appear objective but rest on assumptions
- AI can be used to legitimise contested decisions

This scenario treats AI use at the action stage as **high-impact and high-risk**, because consequences are immediate and real.

---

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before acting on AI-informed data, clarify:
- what decision is actually being made
- what evidence supports different options
- where uncertainty or ambiguity remains
- who will be affected by action or inaction

Key awareness questions:
- What does the data *not* tell us?
- Are we reacting to signal, noise, or pressure?
- What assumptions link insight to action?

AI should inform deliberation, not compel action.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

When translating data into action:
- humans remain accountable for decisions
- AI may support option generation or comparison

Good co-agency means:
- actions are explicitly human-decided
- AI recommendations are challenged and contextualised
- responsibility is not displaced onto systems

Avoid:
- “the data made us do it” reasoning
- treating AI-generated actions as defaults
- using AI to shield decisions from scrutiny

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- generating multiple action options for discussion
- exploring consequences under different assumptions
- identifying implementation risks
- supporting documentation of rationale

Inappropriate uses include:
- automating interventions without review
- using AI to justify predetermined decisions
- collapsing complex judgement into single scores
- bypassing consultation or escalation processes

AI should support *decision quality*, not decision speed alone.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Actions based on data can create harm if poorly governed.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Who benefits and who bears the cost of action?
- Are impacts distributed equitably?
- Could AI-driven urgency override care or fairness?
- Are vulnerable groups disproportionately affected?

Ethical action requires proportionality, transparency, and the option to pause.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Strong governance practices include:
- explicit decision records linking data to action
- clarity about authority and escalation
- checks against policy, regulation, and values
- review mechanisms for high-impact actions

If AI is used:
- document its role in informing action
- ensure human sign-off is explicit
- avoid embedding AI recommendations directly into procedures

This protects legitimacy and institutional trust.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After action is taken, reflect:
- Did outcomes align with expectations?
- Where did judgement add value beyond data?
- What unintended effects emerged?
- How should future decisions be handled differently?

Reflection prevents data-driven action from becoming rigid or unexamined.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What would responsible restraint look like here?
- Are we acting because we should — or because we can?
- How will this action be experienced by those affected?

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Outline alternative actions, including doing nothing.”
- “Identify ethical risks associated with this intervention.”

**Pause & check**
- Are we mistaking data availability for decision necessity?
- Would we defend this action publicly?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following implementation:
- What changed as a result of this action?
- Were harms anticipated and mitigated?
- Did AI use clarify or obscure judgement?
- What governance improvements are needed?

Feed learning into future decision-making processes.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- translate AI-informed data into responsible action
- avoid overreaction and automation bias
- protect fairness, accountability, and trust
- strengthen governance at the point of consequence
- build mature AI capability for action under uncertainty
