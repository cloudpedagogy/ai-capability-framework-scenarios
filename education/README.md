# Education — Scenario Templates and Applied Resources

This folder contains **education-focused scenario templates and applied resources** aligned to the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)**.

Unlike the narrative scenario folders elsewhere in the repository, this directory focuses on **practical, reusable artefacts** that support educators, learning designers, and institutions to operationalise AI capability across teaching, assessment, governance, and student support.

The materials here are designed to be embedded directly into curriculum design, quality assurance, assessment planning, and educational practice.

## What This Folder Is For

The resources in this folder support AI-aware educational practice across:

- Learning outcomes and assessment design  
- Assessment integrity and academic standards  
- Inclusive and accessible learning design  
- Teaching practice, feedback, and learner support  
- Student guidance and AI literacy  
- Academic governance, quality assurance, and defensibility  

They are intentionally **template-based, facilitation-friendly, and context-agnostic**, allowing adaptation to local policies, disciplines, and regulatory environments.

---

## Who These Resources Are For

These materials are intended for:

- Academic staff and programme leaders  
- Learning designers and educational developers  
- Assessment leads and quality assurance teams  
- Educational leadership and governance committees  
- Professional services staff supporting teaching and learning  
- Institutions embedding AI capability at scale  

They can be used independently or alongside the narrative scenarios in other folders.

## What These Resources Are (and Are Not)

### These resources **are**:

- Short, focused Markdown templates
- Designed for direct reuse and adaptation
- Explicitly aligned to one or more AI Capability Framework domains
- Suitable for operational, governance, and pedagogical contexts

### These resources **are not**:

- Full curriculum documents or policy texts
- Tool-specific AI guidance
- Prescriptive compliance checklists without context
- Automated solutions for educational decision-making

They are designed to **support judgement**, not replace it.

## How to Use This Folder

A recommended approach:

1. Identify the educational context you are working in (design, assessment, governance, teaching)
2. Select the relevant template(s)
3. Adapt language, scope, and examples to your institutional context
4. Use alongside narrative scenarios for deeper reflection where needed
5. Document decisions and adaptations for future review

These resources are especially effective when combined with:
- `/templates` (facilitation and reflection tools)
- `/curriculum-design-workshops`
- `/teaching-and-facilitation`

---

## Relationship to Other Folders

This folder provides **operational and design artefacts**.

It complements:
- Scenario-based narrative folders (e.g. teaching, governance, research)
- The `/templates` folder (process-oriented facilitation tools)

Think of this folder as the **“working toolkit”** layer of the Scenario Library.
