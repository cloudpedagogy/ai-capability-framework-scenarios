# Academic Governance and Quality Assurance  
## AI Capability as Governance Infrastructure

As generative AI becomes embedded in teaching, assessment, and curriculum design, institutions are increasingly required to demonstrate not just innovation, but **assurance**.

This folder positions the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) as **governance infrastructure** — a structured way to support academic judgement, protect standards, and evidence decision-making under scrutiny.

Rather than treating AI as a local teaching issue, these resources support institution-level questions such as:
- How are AI-related decisions made and justified?
- How are academic standards protected consistently?
- How is risk identified, documented, and reviewed?
- How can the institution demonstrate due process?

This is the point at which AI capability moves from *practice* to *assurance*.
