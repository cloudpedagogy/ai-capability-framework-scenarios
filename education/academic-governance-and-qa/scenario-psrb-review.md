# Scenario 2: PSRB Accreditation Review

## Scenario Context

A Professional, Statutory or Regulatory Body (PSRB) panel reviews a programme where AI is used to support learning and assessment.

The panel asks:

> “How do you ensure graduates meet professional standards of judgement, responsibility, and accountability when AI tools are involved?”

---

## Task

Prepare a response suitable for a PSRB context, focusing on professional competence rather than academic process alone.

---

## Key Framing

PSRBs are typically concerned with:
- independent professional judgement
- ethical responsibility
- decision-making under constraint
- accountability for outputs

---

## Example Response (PSRB-Appropriate)

> “Our programme designs explicitly assess professional judgement rather than tool output. AI may be used as a support, but students are required to evidence decision-making, justification, and ethical awareness aligned with professional standards. These expectations are embedded in learning outcomes, assessment criteria, and review processes.”

---

## Governance Perspective

From a PSRB standpoint:
- undocumented AI use represents risk
- informal practice undermines assurance
- explicit design strengthens confidence

---

## Outcome

A narrative that:
- aligns AI use with professional standards
- demonstrates accountability
- supports accreditation confidence
