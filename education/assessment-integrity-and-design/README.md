# Assessment Integrity and Design  
## From Detection to Designed Academic Judgement

Assessment integrity is one of the areas where institutions feel most exposed in the context of generative AI.

Traditional integrity approaches often rely on:
- detection and policing
- assumptions about authorship
- retrospective enforcement

These approaches scale poorly in AI-rich environments and create risk for students, staff, and institutions.

This folder reframes **assessment integrity as a design and governance challenge**, grounded in the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition).

Rather than asking *“Was AI used?”*, these resources support teams to ask:
- What is this assessment actually designed to assess?
- Where must human judgement be visible?
- How are expectations made explicit?
- How can this be defended under QA or PSRB scrutiny?

## Intended Users

- Programme and module teams
- Educational developers
- Assessment designers
- Learning technologists
- QA and academic governance staff

---

## QA and Standards Alignment

These resources support principles in the **UK Quality Code for Higher Education**, particularly relating to:

- assessment clarity and fairness
- maintenance of academic standards
- transparency of assessment design
- robustness of academic judgement
- consistency across markers and cohorts

They also align with emerging QAA guidance emphasising:
- explicit communication of AI expectations
- reduction of hidden or informal practice
- design-led responses to AI use

## How to Use This Folder

1. Start with **Scenario 1** to examine AI-aware assessment design
2. Use **Scenario 2** to address marker consistency and fairness
3. Apply **Scenario 3** to redesign for authenticity and judgement
4. Use the rubric template to document expectations clearly
