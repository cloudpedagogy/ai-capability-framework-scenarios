# Scenario 1: Designing AI-Aware Assessment with Integrity

## Scenario Context

A module includes an assessment task that students increasingly complete with the support of generative AI tools. Staff are concerned about integrity, but current responses are informal and inconsistent.

There is no shared articulation of:
- what AI use is permitted
- where judgement must be demonstrated
- how integrity is being protected through design

---

## Task

Review the assessment and identify where integrity risks arise due to **design ambiguity**, not misconduct.

---

## Key Design Questions

- What cognitive work is this assessment meant to evaluate?
- Which parts of the task could be meaningfully supported by AI?
- Where must human judgement be clearly visible?
- What assumptions are currently implicit rather than explicit?

---

## Design Reframing

Rather than banning AI, redesign the assessment so that:
- AI use is acknowledged as a condition of practice
- judgement, evaluation, and decision-making are foregrounded
- expectations are visible to students and markers

---

## QA Perspective

From a QA standpoint, integrity is protected when:
- assessment design is transparent
- expectations are communicated clearly
- judgement is assessable
- governance decisions can be evidenced

---

## Outcome

A revised assessment brief that:
- reduces ambiguity
- makes integrity a design feature
- shifts focus from detection to accountability
