# Scenario 3: Authentic Assessment in an AI-Rich Context

## Scenario Context

A programme team is reviewing whether existing assessments still provide valid evidence of learning in an environment where AI can generate fluent, plausible outputs.

The concern is not cheating, but **authenticity**.

---

## Task

Review an assessment task and identify whether it still requires:
- contextual judgement
- disciplinary reasoning
- defensible decision-making

---

## Authenticity Indicators

Authentic assessment typically requires students to:
- justify choices
- evaluate alternatives
- respond to context or constraints
- explain reasoning processes

These elements are difficult to outsource entirely to AI.

---

## Design Implications

Redesign the task to:
- require explanation of decisions
- include reflective or justificatory components
- assess process as well as outcome

---

## Integrity Framing

Authenticity strengthens integrity by:
- reducing reliance on detection
- increasing the visibility of learning
- aligning assessment with real-world practice

---

## Outcome

An assessment design that:
- remains meaningful in an AI-rich environment
- assesses capability, not just output
- supports defensible academic standards
