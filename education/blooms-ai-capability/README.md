# Bloom’s Taxonomy × AI Capability Framework  
## Scenario Pack for AI-Aware Curriculum Design

This scenario pack demonstrates how the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework can be integrated with Bloom’s Taxonomy in a way that strengthens — rather than dilutes — pedagogic rigour, ethical accountability, and institutional defensibility.

Bloom’s Taxonomy remains one of the most widely used tools for articulating learning outcomes, assessment design, and progression in higher education. However, Bloom alone does not address how artificial intelligence reshapes:
- judgement and decision-making
- ethical responsibility
- academic integrity
- governance, documentation, and auditability

This pack positions Bloom as a **cognitive lens**, and the AI Capability Framework as the **capability and accountability layer** that sits alongside it.

## When to Use This Scenario Pack

This pack is designed for use when teams are:

- redesigning learning outcomes for AI-supported teaching or assessment
- updating programmes in response to institutional AI guidance
- preparing documentation for validation, revalidation, or accreditation
- reviewing assessment practices involving GenAI
- responding to QA, external examiner, or professional body questions about AI use

It is particularly useful in workshops involving:
- programme teams
- educational developers
- learning technologists
- QA and academic governance staff

## What This Pack Is (and Is Not)

**This pack is:**
- a *translation tool* between familiar pedagogy (Bloom) and AI capability
- a way to make AI-related judgement explicit and reviewable
- a practical bridge for institutions early in AI capability development

**This pack is not:**
- a replacement for Bloom’s Taxonomy
- a claim that Bloom addresses ethics or governance
- a prescriptive model of “correct” AI use

The AI Capability Framework does not map neatly onto Bloom levels — and that is intentional. Capability, judgement, and governance cannot be reduced to cognitive verbs.

---

## How Bloom and AI Capability Work Together

- **Bloom answers:** *What kind of cognitive work is being asked of learners?*
- **AI Capability answers:** *How is AI being used, justified, governed, and reflected upon while that work happens?*

Together, they support learning designs that are:
- pedagogically clear
- ethically grounded
- institutionally defensible

---

## Facilitation Notes

- Start with existing outcomes or assessments — do not design from scratch
- Ask participants to identify *where AI is already being used*, formally or informally
- Use the AI Capability domains as prompts for structured discussion, not compliance checks
- Expect productive tension — especially around assessment integrity and disclosure

Recommended flow:
1. Scenario 1: Redesign outcomes
2. Scenario 2: Stress-test assessment
3. Scenario 3: Simulate QA scrutiny
