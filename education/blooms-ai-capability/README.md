# Bloom’s Taxonomy × AI Capability Framework  
## AI-Aware Curriculum Design Scenarios for UK Higher Education

This scenario pack demonstrates how Bloom’s Taxonomy can be integrated with the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework in a way that strengthens academic standards, assessment integrity, and quality assurance in UK higher education.

Bloom’s Taxonomy remains a widely recognised tool for articulating learning outcomes, assessment design, and progression. However, Bloom alone does not address how artificial intelligence reshapes:

- academic judgement
- assessment transparency
- ethical responsibility
- governance and auditability
- professional accountability

This pack positions Bloom as a **cognitive taxonomy** and the AI Capability Framework as the **capability, judgement, and governance layer** required when AI tools are present in learning and assessment.

## Intended Use

This scenario pack is designed for use by:

- programme and module teams
- educational developers
- learning technologists
- quality assurance and governance staff

It is particularly relevant when teams are:

- redesigning learning outcomes where GenAI is used
- reviewing assessment practices involving AI
- preparing validation or revalidation documentation
- responding to external examiner or PSRB queries
- aligning practice with institutional AI guidance

## Alignment with UK Quality Assurance Expectations

### UK Quality Code for Higher Education (QAA)

This resource aligns with principles articulated in the **UK Quality Code for Higher Education**, particularly those relating to:

- clear and assessable learning outcomes
- transparency and fairness in assessment
- maintenance of academic standards
- robustness of academic judgement
- enhancement-led review

Key alignment features include:

- learning outcomes that remain cognitively clear and assessable
- explicit articulation of how AI is used within assessment conditions
- documentation of judgement, not just outputs
- approaches that support consistency across markers and cohorts
- designs that can be explained and defended during review

---

### QAA Guidance on Artificial Intelligence

This pack responds directly to themes emerging in QAA guidance on AI, including:

- the need for explicit communication of expectations
- risks of hidden or informal AI use
- staff and student AI literacy
- assessment integrity and transparency

Rather than treating AI as an integrity problem to be detected, this pack treats AI as a **designed condition of learning** that must be governed.

---

### Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs)

Many PSRBs expect evidence that graduates demonstrate:

- independent judgement and decision-making
- ethical awareness and responsibility
- accountability for professional outputs
- consistency and rigour in assessment

This pack supports PSRB-relevant scrutiny by:

- locating responsibility explicitly with the learner
- requiring students to evidence judgement where AI is used
- supporting programme teams to articulate governance processes
- producing documentation suitable for accreditation panels

---

## What This Pack Is — and Is Not

**This pack is:**
- a practical translation tool between familiar pedagogy and AI capability
- a QA-aware design support resource
- suitable as supporting evidence in validation and review

**This pack is not:**
- a replacement for Bloom’s Taxonomy
- a claim of automatic compliance with QAA or PSRB requirements
- a prescriptive list of permitted AI tools

The AI Capability Framework does not map neatly onto Bloom levels, and no attempt is made to force such a mapping.

---

## Facilitation Guidance

Recommended facilitation sequence:

1. Redesign learning outcomes (Scenario 1)
2. Stress-test assessment and marking practices (Scenario 2)
3. Simulate QA and PSRB scrutiny (Scenario 3)

Facilitators should encourage participants to focus on:
- evidencing judgement
- articulating design decisions
- anticipating challenge rather than avoiding it
