# Dual-Axis Learning Outcome Template  
(Bloom’s Taxonomy × AI Capability)

## Learning Outcome

> [Bloom verb] + [disciplinary object], using AI tools where appropriate, while demonstrating [judgement / transparency / ethical awareness / accountability].

## Bloom’s Taxonomy

- Cognitive Level:  
  ☐ Remember ☐ Understand ☐ Apply ☐ Analyse ☐ Evaluate ☐ Create

---

## AI Capability Considerations (QA-Relevant)

- **Permitted AI Uses:**  
  (e.g. ideation, drafting, synthesis)

- **Judgement Requirement:**  
  Where must independent decision-making be evident?

- **Ethical / Equity Considerations:**  
  Bias, access, transparency, responsibility

- **Governance and Defensibility:**  
  Could this outcome be justified to a validation panel, external examiner, or PSRB?

## Review Checklist

- Is academic level unchanged?
- Is responsibility clearly located with the learner?
- Is AI use explicit but not tool-specific?
- Would this still hold as tools evolve?
