# Scenario 2: Designing an AI-Aware Assessment Rubric

## Scenario Context

A course includes a written analytical assignment. Staff suspect widespread AI use, but:
- marking criteria do not reference AI
- feedback varies widely between markers
- students are unclear what is permitted

You are asked to revise the rubric so it aligns with Bloom’s Taxonomy **and** the AI Capability Framework.

---

## Bloom-Anchored Criterion (Traditional)

**Criterion:** Critical analysis  
**Descriptor:** Demonstrates critical evaluation of sources and arguments.

## AI-Aware Rubric Enhancement

### Revised Criterion: Critical Analysis with AI Support

| Performance Dimension | Indicators |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Cognitive Quality (Bloom) | Analysis shows evaluation, synthesis, and reasoned judgement |
| AI Use Transparency | AI use is clearly described and appropriately bounded |
| Judgement & Control | Student demonstrates decision-making beyond AI output |
| Ethical Awareness | Limitations, bias, or uncertainty are acknowledged |
| Accountability | Work could be defended if questioned |

---

## Marker Guidance (Extract)

Markers should look for:
- evidence that AI outputs were interrogated, not accepted wholesale
- clarity about where human judgement shaped the final submission
- reflective commentary where appropriate

Markers should **not**:
- attempt to detect AI use through style alone
- penalise responsible, disclosed use aligned with guidance

---

## Capability Mapping (Internal)

- Bloom: Analyse / Evaluate
- AI Capability Domains: 2, 3, 4, 5

## Discussion Prompt

> “What does ‘critical thinking’ mean when AI can generate plausible critique?”

Use this question to align marker expectations and reduce inconsistency.
