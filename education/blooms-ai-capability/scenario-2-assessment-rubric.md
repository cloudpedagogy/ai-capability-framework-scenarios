# Scenario 2: Designing an AI-Aware Assessment Rubric

## Scenario Context

A course includes an analytical written assignment. Markers suspect widespread AI use, but:

- assessment criteria do not reference AI
- students receive inconsistent feedback
- markers apply personal interpretations of “acceptable use”

This creates QA risks related to transparency, consistency, and fairness.

## Traditional Criterion

**Criterion:** Critical analysis  
**Descriptor:** Demonstrates critical evaluation of sources and arguments.

While cognitively appropriate, this criterion does not clarify expectations when AI is used.

## AI-Aware Rubric Enhancement

### Revised Criterion: Critical Analysis with AI Support

| Dimension | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| Cognitive Demand (Bloom) | Evidence of evaluation, synthesis, and reasoned judgement |
| AI Use Transparency | AI use is clearly disclosed and appropriately bounded |
| Judgement & Control | Student demonstrates decision-making beyond AI output |
| Ethical Awareness | Limitations, bias, or uncertainty are acknowledged |
| Accountability | Work can be explained and defended if questioned |

---

## Marker Guidance (QA-Relevant)

Markers should look for:

- evidence that AI outputs were interrogated rather than accepted
- clarity about where human judgement shaped the submission
- consistency with communicated guidance

Markers should not:

- attempt to infer AI use from writing style alone
- penalise responsible, disclosed use aligned with assessment design

---

## QA and Assurance Rationale

Explicit reference to AI use in assessment criteria:

- supports consistency between markers
- enhances transparency for students
- reduces reliance on informal practice
- aligns with QAA guidance on assessment integrity and fairness

This reframes AI from an integrity risk to a **designed assessment condition**.

## Capability Mapping (Internal)

- Bloom: Analyse / Evaluate  
- AI Capability Domains: 2, 3, 4, 5
