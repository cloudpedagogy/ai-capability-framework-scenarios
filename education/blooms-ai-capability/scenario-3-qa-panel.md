# Scenario 3: QA Panel Challenge — Defending AI-Supported Design

## Scenario Context

You are presenting a programme for approval or review. A panel member asks:

> “How can you assure us that students are still exercising independent judgement when AI tools are involved?”

This scenario simulates that challenge.

---

## Your Task

Prepare a response that draws on:
- Bloom’s Taxonomy
- the AI Capability Framework
- documented design decisions

---

## Weak Response (What to Avoid)

> “We trust students to use AI responsibly.”

This response lacks:
- evidence
- process
- governance

---

## Strong, Defensible Response (Example)

> “Our learning outcomes and assessment criteria are designed to assess higher-order cognitive skills such as evaluation and synthesis. AI use is permitted as a support tool, but students are required to demonstrate how judgement was exercised, where AI outputs were limited or challenged, and how ethical considerations were addressed. These expectations are embedded in our rubrics and communicated explicitly to students.”

---

## Panel Follow-Up Questions (Simulated)

- How is this communicated to students?
- How are markers supported?
- How is consistency monitored?
- How will this adapt as tools evolve?

---

## Capability Lens

This scenario primarily exercises:
- **Domain 5 – Decision-Making & Governance**
- supported by Domains 2, 3, and 6

---

## Outcome

Participants should leave able to:
- articulate AI-aware design decisions clearly
- distinguish trust from governance
- evidence capability, not just intention
