# Dual-Axis Learning Outcome Template  
(Bloom × AI Capability)

## Learning Outcome

> [Bloom verb] + [disciplinary object], using AI tools where appropriate, while demonstrating [judgement / ethics / transparency / governance expectations].

---

## Bloom’s Taxonomy

- Cognitive Level:  
  ☐ Remember ☐ Understand ☐ Apply ☐ Analyse ☐ Evaluate ☐ Create

---

## AI Capability Considerations

- **Permitted AI Uses:**  
  (e.g. ideation, drafting, synthesis)

- **Learner Judgement Required:**  
  (Where must human decision-making be evident?)

- **Ethical / Equity Considerations:**  
  (Bias, access, transparency)

- **Governance / Defensibility:**  
  (Could this outcome be justified to QA or accreditation?)

---

## Notes for Review

- Is AI use explicit but not tool-specific?
- Is responsibility clearly located with the learner?
- Would this still hold if tools change?
