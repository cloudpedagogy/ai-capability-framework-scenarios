# Inclusive and Accessible Learning  
## AI, Equity, and Differential Impact by Design

Equity, accessibility, and inclusion are increasingly central to quality assurance, regulatory scrutiny, and institutional strategy in higher education.

The introduction of generative AI intensifies these concerns. AI can:
- reduce barriers for some learners
- introduce new forms of disadvantage for others
- amplify existing inequities if left unexamined

This folder supports programme and module teams to design **AI-aware learning and assessment** that are:
- inclusive by intention
- accessible by design
- defensible under QA, EDI, and disability-support scrutiny

Rather than treating accessibility as a retrofit, these resources position inclusion as a **core design and governance responsibility** within the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition).

## Alignment with UK Policy and Practice

These resources map cleanly to:
- **UK Quality Code for Higher Education** (fairness, parity of experience)
- Institutional **EDI strategies**
- **Disability support and reasonable adjustments**
- **Widening participation** and inclusive curriculum agendas

They also support emerging expectations that AI-related design decisions:
- consider differential impact
- are transparent and reviewable
- avoid embedding hidden disadvantage
