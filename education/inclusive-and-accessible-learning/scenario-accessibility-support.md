# Scenario 1: AI as Accessibility Support

## Scenario Context

A module team becomes aware that some students are using generative AI tools to:
- support writing and structuring
- clarify complex language
- manage cognitive load

Some students disclose this use as an informal accessibility strategy. Others do not disclose at all.

Staff are uncertain whether this use:
- constitutes an unfair advantage
- overlaps with reasonable adjustments
- should be formally acknowledged or designed for

---

## Task

Examine how AI is currently functioning as an *informal accessibility aid* within the module.

---

## Key Questions

- Which barriers is AI helping some students overcome?
- Which students may be disadvantaged if AI use is restricted or penalised?
- Are expectations around AI use clear and equitable?
- How does this interact with existing reasonable adjustments?

---

## Design Considerations

Rather than responding through prohibition, consider:
- whether accessibility-related AI use can be made explicit
- how transparency can be encouraged without stigma
- where judgement and learning outcomes remain intact

---

## QA and Accessibility Perspective

From an inclusion and QA standpoint:
- hidden accessibility practices create inequity
- informal adjustments lack governance
- explicit design supports parity of experience

---

## Outcome

A clearer articulation of:
- how AI can support accessibility
- where limits apply
- how inclusion and academic standards are jointly protected
