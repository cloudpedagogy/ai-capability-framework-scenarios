# Scenario 2: Identifying Equity and Differential-Impact Risks

## Scenario Context

A programme adopts AI-supported learning activities assuming all students will benefit equally.

However, differences emerge related to:
- access to paid tools
- prior AI literacy
- language background
- confidence in disclosing AI use

These differences are not reflected in programme documentation.

---

## Task

Identify where AI-related design decisions may introduce **differential impact**.

---

## Equity Risk Prompts

Consider whether:
- some students gain advantage through better access or familiarity
- others experience increased anxiety or uncertainty
- expectations rely on unspoken assumptions
- support structures are unevenly distributed

---

## Design Mitigations

Possible responses include:
- clarifying permitted AI uses
- providing baseline AI literacy support
- avoiding assessment designs that reward concealment
- monitoring impact across cohorts

---

## Governance Perspective

From a governance standpoint:
- unexamined differential impact represents institutional risk
- equity considerations should be documented
- review cycles should include inclusion-focused reflection

---

## Outcome

A set of identified equity risks and corresponding design or support actions that can be evidenced during QA or EDI review.
