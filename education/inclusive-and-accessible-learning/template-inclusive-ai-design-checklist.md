# Template: Inclusive and Accessible AI Design Checklist

Use this checklist during curriculum design, assessment review, or validation to ensure AI-related decisions support inclusion and equity.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

- ☐ Does the design reduce or increase cognitive load?
- ☐ Are accessibility-supporting AI uses acknowledged?
- ☐ Are reasonable adjustments complemented, not undermined?

---

## Equity and Differential Impact

- ☐ Do all students have comparable access to required tools?
- ☐ Are assumptions about AI literacy made explicit?
- ☐ Could this design advantage students who conceal AI use?

---

## Transparency and Communication

- ☐ Are expectations around AI use clearly communicated?
- ☐ Is transparency encouraged without penalty?
- ☐ Are support routes signposted clearly?

---

## Assessment Integrity

- ☐ Is learning assessed through judgement and reasoning?
- ☐ Does the assessment avoid rewarding surface fluency alone?
- ☐ Are criteria applied consistently across students?

---

## Governance and Review

- ☐ Are inclusion-related design decisions documented?
- ☐ Could this be explained to QA or disability support teams?
- ☐ Is there a plan to review impact over time?

## Action Summary

☐ No action required  
☐ Clarification needed  
☐ Design adjustment required
