# Learning Outcomes and Assessment  
## AI-Aware Design Using the AI Capability Framework

This folder supports programme and module teams in designing, reviewing, and defending learning outcomes and assessment practices in contexts where generative AI is present.

Learning outcomes and assessment alignment sit at the centre of academic standards, quality assurance, and professional accreditation. As AI becomes embedded in learning practice, institutions must ensure that outcomes and assessments:

- remain cognitively clear and level-appropriate
- explicitly account for AI use where relevant
- assess independent judgement, not just outputs
- are transparent, consistent, and defensible under review

This resource integrates:
- **Bloom’s Taxonomy** (to define cognitive demand)
- **The CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** (to surface judgement, ethics, and governance)

---

## Intended Users

- Programme and module teams
- Educational developers
- Learning technologists
- QA and academic governance staff
- External examiners and PSRB reviewers (as supporting evidence)

---

## QA and Standards Alignment

This folder supports principles articulated in the **UK Quality Code for Higher Education**, including:

- clarity and alignment of learning outcomes
- transparency and fairness in assessment
- maintenance of academic standards
- robustness of academic judgement
- enhancement-led review

AI use is treated as a **designed condition of learning**, not an informal or hidden practice.

## How to Use These Materials

1. Start with **Scenario 1** to review and redesign learning outcomes
2. Use **Scenario 2** to check alignment between outcomes and assessment
3. Apply **Scenario 3** to stress-test designs against QA or PSRB scrutiny
4. Use the templates to document decisions for validation or review
