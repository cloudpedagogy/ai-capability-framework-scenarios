# Scenario 1: Redesigning Learning Outcomes for AI-Aware Practice

## Scenario Context

A programme team is reviewing learning outcomes for a module in which students are already using generative AI tools for:

- drafting and structuring written work
- summarising or comparing sources
- generating ideas or alternative perspectives

The existing learning outcomes do not reference AI use, judgement, or responsibility. This creates risk during QA review, as there is a disconnect between:

- actual learning practice
- assessment design
- what the programme claims to assess

---

## Existing Learning Outcome

> “Critically analyse key theoretical perspectives in the discipline.”

The outcome is cognitively appropriate but silent on the conditions under which analysis occurs.

---

## Task

Redesign the learning outcome so that it:

1. Retains a clear Bloom-level cognitive demand  
2. Makes AI use explicit where relevant  
3. Locates responsibility and judgement with the learner  
4. Remains defensible under validation, revalidation, or PSRB review  

---

## Example Revised Outcome

> “Critically analyse key theoretical perspectives in the discipline, using generative AI tools where appropriate to support comparison and synthesis, while demonstrating independent judgement, transparency of method, and ethical awareness in line with institutional AI guidance.”

---

## QA and Standards Considerations

Programme teams should be able to answer:

- Is the academic level unchanged?
- Are expectations clear to students and markers?
- Is AI use explicit but not tool-specific?
- Could this outcome be justified to an external examiner?

This scenario supports QAA expectations that learning outcomes are:
- clearly articulated
- aligned with assessment
- reflective of current educational practice

---

## AI Capability Reflection Prompts

- **Awareness:** What AI literacy is assumed?
- **Human–AI Co-Agency:** Where must human judgement be visible?
- **Applied Practice:** What AI uses are encouraged or bounded?
- **Ethics & Equity:** Are there differential impacts?
- **Governance:** How would this be evidenced if challenged?
- **Reflection:** How will this be reviewed over time?

---

## Output

A revised set of learning outcomes that:
- align with assessment practice
- surface AI use transparently
- support defensible academic standards
