# Scenario 2: Aligning Assessment with AI-Aware Learning Outcomes

## Scenario Context

A module has recently updated its learning outcomes to acknowledge AI use. However, assessment tasks and marking criteria remain unchanged.

This creates misalignment between:
- stated learning outcomes
- what is actually assessed
- what markers are instructed to look for

---

## Task

Review an existing assessment task and determine whether it genuinely assesses the revised learning outcomes.

---

## Example Assessment (Before)

**Task:**  
2,500-word critical essay analysing contemporary research literature.

**Criteria:**  
- Critical analysis  
- Use of sources  
- Structure and clarity  

AI use is neither acknowledged nor addressed.

---

## Alignment Risks

- Students may use AI extensively without guidance
- Markers apply inconsistent expectations
- Judgement and decision-making are invisible
- QA defensibility is weakened

---

## AI-Aware Alignment Adjustments

Possible changes include:
- adding a short methodological transparency statement
- revising criteria to include judgement and decision-making
- clarifying permitted and discouraged AI uses

---

## QA Perspective

From a QA standpoint, alignment requires that:
- learning outcomes
- assessment tasks
- marking criteria

all reflect the same assumptions about AI use.

Hidden AI use represents a governance gap.

---

## Outcome

An assessment design that:
- clearly aligns with revised learning outcomes
- assesses higher-order cognition and judgement
- supports consistent marking
- can be defended during review
