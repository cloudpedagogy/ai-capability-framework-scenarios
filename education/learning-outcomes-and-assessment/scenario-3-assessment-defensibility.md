# Scenario 3: Defending AI-Aware Assessment Design

## Scenario Context

During validation or revalidation, a panel member asks:

> “How does this assessment ensure students are demonstrating independent academic judgement when AI tools are involved?”

This scenario focuses on preparing a defensible response.

---

## Weak Response (Avoid)

> “Students are expected to use AI responsibly.”

This lacks:
- evidence
- process
- governance

---

## Strong Response (Example)

> “The assessment continues to target higher-order cognitive skills such as evaluation and synthesis. AI use is explicitly designed into the assessment conditions. Students are required to demonstrate how judgement was exercised, where AI outputs were challenged or limited, and how ethical considerations were addressed. These expectations are embedded in the marking criteria and communicated clearly to students and markers.”

---

## Typical Follow-Up Questions

- How is this communicated to students?
- How are markers calibrated?
- How is consistency monitored?
- How will this adapt as AI tools evolve?

---

## Capability Focus

Primary: **Decision-Making & Governance**  
Supporting: Human–AI Co-Agency, Applied Practice, Reflection

---

## Outcome

Participants should be able to:
- articulate assessment design decisions clearly
- distinguish trust from governance
- evidence maintenance of academic standards
