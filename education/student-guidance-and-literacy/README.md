# Student Guidance and AI Literacy  
## Capability, Clarity, and Institutional Responsibility

Students increasingly encounter generative AI as part of their learning environment, whether or not this use is formally acknowledged in course design.

Institutions face a dual responsibility:
- students need **clear, consistent guidance** about AI use
- guidance must be **defensible, equitable, and aligned with academic standards**

This folder frames student AI literacy not as rule-following or compliance, but as **capability development** supported and mediated by the institution.

Rather than focusing on detection or prohibition, these resources help institutions:
- articulate expectations clearly
- support responsible and ethical student practice
- reduce uncertainty and inequity
- evidence due process under QA or external scrutiny

These materials align with the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) and are designed to sit alongside institutional policy, not replace it.

## Intended Users

- Programme and module teams
- Educational developers
- Student support and academic skills teams
- Learning technologists
- QA and academic governance staff

Students are the **audience**, but not the sole responsibility holder.

## Alignment with UK QA and Institutional Practice

These resources support:
- clarity and fairness under the **UK Quality Code for Higher Education**
- consistent communication of expectations
- reduction of hidden or informal AI use
- parity of student experience across modules and programmes

They also help institutions demonstrate that student guidance:
- is intentionally designed
- does not rely on ad hoc interpretation
- is reviewed and updated as practice evolves

## How to Use This Folder

1. Use the **scenario** to test whether current student guidance is clear and defensible
2. Adapt the **template** to produce institutionally approved guidance
3. Embed outputs into module handbooks, VLEs, or skills provision

These resources are suitable for:
- programme-level consistency
- staff development discussions
- QA documentation and review
