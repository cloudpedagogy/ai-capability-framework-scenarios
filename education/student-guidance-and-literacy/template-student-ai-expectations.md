# Template: Student Expectations for AI Use

Use this template to create clear, consistent, and defensible student guidance on AI use.

This guidance should be approved at programme or institutional level.

---

## Purpose

Explain why AI use is being addressed in this course or programme.

(e.g. to support learning, maintain academic standards, and ensure fairness)

---

## General Principle

Students remain responsible for:
- the ideas they submit
- the decisions they make
- the integrity of their work

AI tools may support learning, but they do not replace academic judgement.

---

## Permitted Uses of AI

Examples may include:
- generating ideas or outlines
- supporting clarity or structure
- exploring alternative perspectives

State clearly that permitted uses may vary by assessment.

---

## Uses That Require Care or Are Not Appropriate

Examples may include:
- submitting AI-generated work without engagement
- misrepresenting AI output as personal judgement
- using AI in ways that undermine the purpose of the assessment

---

## Transparency and Disclosure

Explain:
- when students should acknowledge AI use
- how transparency supports fairness
- that disclosure is not penalised when aligned with guidance

---

## Support and Development

Signpost:
- AI literacy support
- academic skills provision
- opportunities to ask questions or seek clarification

---

## Review and Adaptation

State that guidance will be:
- reviewed as tools and practice evolve
- updated in line with institutional policy

---

## Closing Statement

This guidance is intended to support responsible, ethical, and confident learning with AI, in line with institutional values and academic standards.
