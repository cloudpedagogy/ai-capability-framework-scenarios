# Teaching Practice and Feedback  
## AI as a Teaching Partner, Not a Replacement

For many lecturers, the most pressing question about AI is not *“What does policy say?”* but *“What should I do tomorrow?”*

Generative AI is already being used by students and staff in everyday teaching practice:
- drafting feedback
- clarifying explanations
- generating examples
- supporting formative learning

This folder supports teaching staff to use AI **confidently, responsibly, and pragmatically**, without undermining professional judgement or pedagogical intent.

The focus is on:
- augmenting teaching practice
- improving feedback quality and consistency
- maintaining academic standards
- reducing workload without reducing care

These resources align with the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) while remaining approachable and practice-led.

## Pedagogical Framing

AI is positioned here as:
- a *partner* in teaching practice
- a support for reflection and consistency
- a tool to enhance, not replace, academic judgement

The emphasis is not on automation, but on **co-agency**: staff remain responsible for decisions, tone, and pedagogical intent.
