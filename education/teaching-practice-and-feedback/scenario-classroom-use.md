# Scenario 2: AI Use in Classroom and Seminar Teaching

## Scenario Context

A lecturer considers using generative AI during teaching sessions to:
- generate examples
- explore alternative explanations
- respond to student questions in real time

There is uncertainty about whether this undermines teaching authority or student learning.

---

## Task

Examine how AI might be used **in service of teaching**, not as a substitute for it.

---

## Key Considerations

- Is AI being used to prompt discussion or provide answers?
- Does AI use model critical engagement or passive consumption?
- Are students aware of how and why AI is being used?

---

## Teaching Practice Framing

AI can be used to:
- surface multiple perspectives
- demonstrate evaluation of outputs
- model critical questioning

Effective use requires:
- clear pedagogical intent
- visible lecturer judgement
- explicit framing for students

---

## Student Experience

When used transparently:
- AI can support engagement
- uncertainty is reduced
- critical thinking is modelled

---

## Outcome

A classroom practice where:
- AI use is intentional and bounded
- lecturer expertise remains central
- students see critical engagement in action
