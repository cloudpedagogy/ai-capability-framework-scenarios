# Scenario 1: Using AI to Support Feedback Practice

## Scenario Context

A lecturer is responsible for providing written feedback to a large cohort. Time pressure has led to concerns about:
- consistency of feedback
- depth of commentary
- ability to provide constructive guidance

The lecturer considers using generative AI to support feedback writing but is unsure where professional judgement should sit.

---

## Task

Explore how AI could support feedback **without outsourcing judgement or care**.

---

## Reflective Questions

- Which parts of feedback are repetitive or structural?
- Where does disciplinary judgement matter most?
- What aspects of feedback require human sensitivity or context?

---

## AI-Supported Approach

Possible uses of AI include:
- drafting feedback structure
- generating formative suggestions
- improving clarity and tone

The lecturer remains responsible for:
- accuracy
- prioritisation
- final wording
- alignment with assessment criteria

---

## Pedagogical Perspective

From a teaching perspective:
- AI can support consistency
- human judgement ensures relevance and care
- transparency maintains trust

---

## Outcome

A feedback process that:
- improves efficiency
- maintains academic standards
- preserves the lecturer–student relationship
