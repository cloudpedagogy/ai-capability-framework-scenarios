# Governance and Decision-Making — Scenario Set

This folder contains **scenario-based applications of the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on governance, risk, policy, ethics, and accountable decision-making.

These scenarios address moments where **AI use intersects with authority, responsibility, and institutional legitimacy** — such as approvals, risk review, policy formation, and accountability checkpoints.

They are designed to support **defensible, transparent, and human-led decision-making**, particularly in contexts where AI can easily obscure judgement, shift responsibility, or create false confidence.

---

## What This Folder Is For

The scenarios in this folder support organisations to:

- Make AI-supported decisions that are **accountable and auditable**
- Surface ethical, legal, and institutional risks early
- Clarify roles, authority, and responsibility in AI-influenced processes
- Strengthen governance maturity without over-bureaucratisation
- Avoid treating AI outputs as substitutes for judgement

They are particularly relevant where decisions may later be scrutinised, challenged, or require justification.

---

## Who These Scenarios Are For

These scenarios are designed for:

- Senior leaders and decision-makers  
- Governance, compliance, and risk professionals  
- Ethics committees and approval panels  
- Policy authors and reviewers  
- Programme, portfolio, and assurance leads  
- Public-sector and regulated-environment teams  

They can be used for **individual reflection, facilitated discussion, governance training, or committee development**.

---

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios **are**:

- Narrative, context-rich scenarios grounded in real governance practice
- Explicitly mapped to all six AI Capability Framework domains
- Designed to slow down decisions where appropriate
- Suitable for workshops, panels, and leadership conversations

### These scenarios **are not**:

- Legal advice or regulatory interpretations
- Automated decision frameworks
- Checklists that replace professional judgement
- Tool- or vendor-specific guidance

They are designed to **strengthen governance capability**, not to automate it.

## How to Use These Scenarios

A recommended approach:

1. Select the scenario most relevant to your governance context
2. Read the full narrative collectively or individually
3. Use the six framework domains to structure discussion
4. Explicitly surface assumptions, risks, and decision boundaries
5. Document outcomes, dissent, and learning where appropriate

These scenarios are especially effective when used alongside:
- `/templates` (Pre-Activity Briefs, Prompt Cards, Reflections)
- `/leadership-and-strategy`
- `/meetings-and-collaboration`

---

## Relationship to Other Folders

This folder focuses on **institutional authority and formal decision-making**.

It complements:
