# Immersive and Extended Reality — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on immersive and extended reality contexts, including **virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and AI-driven simulations**.

Immersive technologies introduce a distinct shift in how people experience learning, decision-making, risk, and authority. When combined with AI-driven adaptation, virtual agents, or automated feedback, these environments can strongly shape perception, emotion, and behaviour.

As a result, immersive systems represent a **high-impact, high-responsibility domain** for AI capability.

## Why this folder matters

Immersive and XR systems:

- blur boundaries between simulation and evaluation  
- amplify emotional and cognitive impact  
- can invisibly steer judgement and behaviour  
- raise accessibility, inclusion, and consent concerns  
- are increasingly used in high-stakes contexts (training, assessment, safety, leadership)

Many AI governance frameworks under-address **experiential power** — how systems influence people through immersion rather than instruction. This scenario set explicitly addresses that gap.

---

## Who this set is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Educators and trainers using VR or simulation-based learning
- Learning designers and learning technologists
- Professional development and CPD leads
- Researchers using immersive environments
- Ethics panels, governance teams, and risk reviewers
- Organisations deploying AI-driven simulations

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Facilitation-ready, reflective guides
- Grounded in realistic immersive use cases
- Explicitly aligned to all six AI Capability Framework domains
- Designed to surface ethical, psychological, and governance risks
- Suitable for education, research, training, and professional contexts

### These scenarios are not:

- Technical VR build guides
- Vendor-specific platform documentation
- Marketing narratives for immersive technology
- Automation or surveillance playbooks

They sit **between policy and practice**, supporting responsible judgement where immersive AI systems shape experience.

## How to use this set

A recommended approach:

1. Select a scenario aligned to your immersive context
2. Clarify the learning or development purpose before deployment
3. Work through the six Framework domains collaboratively
4. Use AI and VR as experiential inputs — not evaluators
5. Facilitate structured debrief and reflection
6. Capture ethical, design, and governance learning

These scenarios pair well with:
- teaching and facilitation scenarios
- assessment and quality judgement scenarios
- ethics, governance, and risk review processes
