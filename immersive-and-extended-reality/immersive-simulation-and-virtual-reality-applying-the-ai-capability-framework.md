# Immersive Simulation and Virtual Reality: Applying the AI Capability Framework

**Framework:** CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)  
**Licence:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports the use of **immersive simulation and virtual reality (VR)** in learning, training, research, and professional development contexts where AI may shape environments, interactions, feedback, or pacing.

Immersive simulations are often introduced to increase realism, engagement, and experiential learning. When combined with AI — such as adaptive environments, automated feedback, or generative scenario variation — these systems can exert strong influence over perception, emotion, and judgement.

The purpose of this scenario is to help organisations use immersive simulation responsibly, ensuring that **experiential power, psychological impact, and evaluative boundaries** are understood and governed — and that human judgement, interpretation, and care remain central.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Educators and trainers using VR or simulation-based learning  
- Learning designers and learning technologists  
- CPD and professional training leads  
- Researchers using immersive environments  
- Ethics, governance, and risk review teams

## 2. Situation & Context

An organisation is planning or delivering an immersive simulation using VR or extended reality (XR). The simulation may be intended to:

- rehearse professional, ethical, or safety-critical scenarios  
- develop skills through experiential learning  
- expose participants to complex or high-risk environments safely  
- support reflection, empathy, or perspective-taking  

AI may be used to:

- adapt the simulation dynamically  
- generate branching scenarios or events  
- model behaviours, environments, or consequences  
- provide automated prompts or feedback  

At this stage, key decisions must be made about **purpose, framing, facilitation, and boundaries**.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in immersive simulation to:

- adjust difficulty, pacing, or environmental conditions  
- generate responses from simulated agents or systems  
- provide real-time or post-experience feedback  
- personalise experiences across participants  

These uses matter because:

- immersive environments amplify emotional and cognitive impact  
- participants may interpret simulation responses as judgement or evaluation  
- AI-driven adaptation can obscure design assumptions  
- realism can blur the line between experience and endorsement  

This scenario treats AI-enabled immersive simulation as **high-impact and ethically sensitive**, even when no formal assessment is intended.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before deploying immersive simulation, teams should clarify:

- the learning or developmental purpose of the simulation  
- whether the experience is exploratory, developmental, or evaluative  
- what assumptions are embedded in the simulated environment  

Key awareness questions:

- What is this simulation designed to support learning about?  
- What emotional or psychological responses might it provoke?  
- Where could realism be mistaken for authority or truth?  

AI should be used to **support sensemaking**, not to manufacture certainty or performance judgement.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In immersive simulations:

- humans remain responsible for interpretation and meaning-making  
- AI may shape environments or events, but not conclusions  

Good co-agency means:

- facilitators explicitly frame the role of AI in the simulation  
- participants understand that AI responses are design artefacts  
- learning outcomes are discussed and interpreted collectively  

Avoid:

- allowing AI adaptation to function as hidden evaluation  
- positioning AI-generated responses as authoritative feedback  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:

- generating varied scenarios for exploration and rehearsal  
- modelling uncertainty or competing pressures intentionally  
- supporting structured post-simulation reflection  

Inappropriate uses include:

- scoring or ranking participant behaviour implicitly  
- generating conclusions about competence or suitability  
- escalating consequences without transparency  

AI should support **experiential learning**, not covert assessment.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Immersive simulations raise ethical and equity concerns.

Use the Framework to ask:

- Could this experience cause distress or harm?  
- Are scenarios culturally, socially, or professionally biased?  
- Do participants have meaningful consent and exit options?  

Ethical immersive design prioritises psychological safety, inclusion, and care.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:

- clarity about whether simulations are evaluative or developmental  
- documentation of AI roles and design assumptions  
- clear escalation pathways for participant concerns  

If AI is used:

- disclose its role clearly to participants  
- avoid repurposing simulation data without consent  
- ensure human oversight of interpretation and follow-up  

This supports trust, legitimacy, and defensibility.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After immersive simulations, reflect:

- How did AI influence participant experience and interpretation?  
- Where did realism support or hinder learning?  
- What design changes are needed for future use?  

Reflection helps organisations develop **mature, responsible immersive capability**.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**

- What is this experience encouraging participants to believe or feel?  
- Are we prioritising realism over learning?  
- Where might participants need support or debriefing?  

**Optional AI prompts**

- “Generate alternative scenario outcomes based on different assumptions.”  
- “Summarise points of uncertainty or ethical tension raised during the simulation.”  

**Pause & check**

- Is AI amplifying learning or emotional pressure?  
- Would slowing down improve understanding?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following immersive simulations:

- What learning outcomes were actually achieved?  
- Were any unintended impacts observed?  
- How should AI use be refined or constrained next time?  

Feed insights into design, facilitation, and governance processes.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:

- use immersive simulation responsibly and transparently  
- avoid covert evaluation through AI-enabled environments  
- protect psychological safety and participant trust  
- strengthen ethical and governance alignment  
- build reflective, human-centred immersive AI capability
