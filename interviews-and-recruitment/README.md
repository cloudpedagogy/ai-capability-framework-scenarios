# Interviews and Recruitment — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on interviews and recruitment processes.

These scenarios address moments where judgement, fairness, accountability, and trust are most exposed — and where inappropriate or unreflective AI use can directly undermine equity, defensibility, and organisational credibility.

The emphasis is on **using AI cautiously and transparently**, while ensuring that evaluation, selection, and decision-making remain unequivocally human-led.

## Who This Set Is For

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Interview panel members and chairs  
- Hiring managers and academic leads  
- HR, people, and governance partners  
- Professional services staff supporting recruitment

They are suitable for individual preparation, panel calibration, governance discussion, and staff development.

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended approach:

1. Select the scenario that matches your recruitment stage  
2. Read the scenario individually or as a panel  
3. Use the six framework domains to structure discussion  
4. Apply optional AI prompts cautiously and transparently  
5. Document decisions, uncertainties, and reflections  
6. Feed learning into future recruitment practice  

The scenarios are designed to be **used before, during, and after** recruitment activity — not only as retrospective guidance.

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

This folder focuses on **recruitment and selection processes from the organisational perspective**.

Related but distinct folders include:

- **Career Transition and Employability**  
  Focuses on individual candidates using AI ethically and credibly during job search and career change.

- **Governance and Decision-Making**  
  Addresses broader approval, risk, and accountability contexts that may intersect with recruitment.

- **Meetings and Collaboration**  
  Covers facilitation and decision practices that may underpin interview panels or selection committees.

The separation is intentional and helps maintain clarity between **individual self-use of AI** and **institutional decision-making responsibilities**.
