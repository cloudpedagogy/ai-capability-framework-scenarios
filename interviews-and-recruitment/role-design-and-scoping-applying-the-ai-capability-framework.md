## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports the design and scoping of roles before recruitment begins, where early decisions strongly shape fairness, inclusion, and long-term organisational fit.

It addresses a common professional tension: the temptation to use AI to speed up job design versus the responsibility to ensure roles are well-judged, equitable, and genuinely aligned to real needs.

The aim is not to automate role design, but to help professionals use AI as a reflective and analytical partner while retaining human judgement, accountability, and values-based decision-making.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Hiring managers and academic leads  
- HR and people partners  
- Programme directors and research leads  
- Panel chairs and senior decision-makers  

---

## 2. Situation and Context

A new role is being created, or an existing role is being re-scoped. This may be driven by:

- organisational change  
- new funding or projects  
- strategic priorities  
- workload pressures  
- succession planning  

At this stage:

- time is often limited  
- assumptions about “what the role should be” are strong  
- informal language and inherited criteria are common  

Decisions made here will influence:

- who feels able to apply  
- how candidates are evaluated later  
- whether the role actually solves the intended problem  

AI may be considered to help draft role descriptions, define criteria, or benchmark similar roles — but these uses carry hidden risks if not carefully bounded.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI is often introduced at this stage to:

- draft job descriptions quickly  
- suggest role responsibilities or skills  
- benchmark against sector norms  
- rewrite or “polish” language  

These uses matter because:

- early wording shapes who self-selects out  
- AI systems often reproduce dominant norms  
- over-specification can unintentionally exclude  

This scenario therefore treats AI use in role design as **high-impact, medium-risk**, requiring explicit judgement and reflection.

AI should support sensemaking, not define the role.

---

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, clarify:

- the real organisational problem this role is meant to address  
- which aspects are genuinely uncertain or need exploration  
- what assumptions are already embedded in draft ideas  

Key awareness questions:

- Are we designing a role, or copying a familiar pattern?  
- What constraints (budget, grade, governance) already exist?  
- What knowledge about this role is tacit rather than explicit?  

AI should be used to surface blind spots, not replace this thinking.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

At this stage:

- humans must remain the authors of the role  
- AI may act as a challenger, comparator, or clarifier  

Good co-agency means:

- humans decide what the role is for  
- AI supports exploration of alternatives  
- responsibility for inclusion and fairness remains human  

Explicitly avoid:

- allowing AI to determine essential criteria  
- outsourcing judgement about seniority or scope  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses in this scenario include:

- generating alternative role framings  
- stress-testing essential vs desirable criteria  
- identifying potentially exclusionary language  
- comparing role scope across sectors  

Inappropriate uses include:

- finalising job descriptions without review  
- generating grading or pay decisions  
- defining selection criteria in isolation  

AI outputs should always be treated as draft thinking artefacts, not decisions.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity and Impact

This is a critical stage for equity.

Key risks include:

- reproducing gendered or exclusionary language  
- over-emphasising credentialism  
- embedding unrealistic expectations  

Use the Framework to ask:

- Who might this role unintentionally exclude?  
- What assumptions about career paths are present?  
- Does this role privilege familiarity with certain systems or cultures?  

AI can help surface these issues — but cannot resolve them alone.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making and Governance

Ensure that:

- the rationale for role scope is documented  
- any AI-assisted inputs are transparent  
- final decisions are traceable to human judgement  

Good governance practices include:

- retaining early drafts  
- recording key design decisions  
- noting where AI influenced thinking (and where it did not)  

This protects both individuals and the organisation.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning and Renewal

After the role is scoped, reflect:

- What assumptions were challenged?  
- Where did AI help clarify thinking?  
- Where did it risk narrowing options?  

This reflection supports organisational learning, not just one-off hiring.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts and Checks

### Human reflection prompts

- What problem will still exist if this role is filled?  
- What would success look like in the first year?  
- What are we assuming about the “ideal” candidate?  

### Optional AI prompts

- “Identify potentially exclusionary language in this role description.”  
- “Suggest alternative framings of this role focused on outcomes rather than credentials.”  
- “Highlight assumptions embedded in these essential criteria.”  

### Pause and check

- Are we comfortable defending this role design publicly?  
- Could this role be scoped more flexibly without losing purpose?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Once the role description is finalised:

- What changed from the initial draft?  
- Where did AI meaningfully improve clarity or fairness?  
- What would we do differently next time?  

Capture insights to inform future role design processes.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations to:

- design roles more intentionally and equitably  
- avoid downstream recruitment bias  
- use AI responsibly at a high-impact decision point  
- strengthen accountability and governance  
- build AI capability through real work, not training alone
