# Leadership and Strategy — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on leadership, strategy, and high-level decision-making contexts.

These scenarios address moments where uncertainty, power, values, and long-term consequences intersect — and where uncritical or overconfident AI use can distort judgement, mask trade-offs, or undermine legitimacy.

The emphasis is on **using AI to support sensemaking and deliberation**, while ensuring that strategic direction, accountability, and ethical responsibility remain firmly human-led.

## Who This Set Is For

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Senior leadership teams  
- Strategy, planning, and transformation leads  
- Board members and governors  
- Portfolio, investment, and prioritisation committees  
- Facilitators of strategic and foresight processes  

They are suitable for leadership development, strategy awaydays, governance discussion, and reflective practice.

---

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios are:

- Practical, context-rich applications of the AI Capability Framework  
- Focused on real strategic moments with high ambiguity and consequence  
- Explicitly mapped to all six framework domains  
- Designed to surface assumptions, values, and trade-offs  
- Suitable for facilitated sessions, workshops, or leadership reflection  

### These scenarios are not:

- AI-driven optimisation or forecasting tools  
- Decision-automation playbooks  
- Prescriptive strategy templates  
- Substitutes for leadership judgement or accountability

## Scenarios in This Folder

### `strategy-awaydays-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports extended **strategy awaydays and leadership retreats**.

Focuses on:
- Using AI to enrich strategic exploration without false foresight  
- Surfacing assumptions and competing narratives  
- Preventing premature convergence around AI-generated futures  

---

### `sensemaking-under-uncertainty-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **collective sensemaking in highly uncertain environments**.

Focuses on:
- Holding ambiguity and disagreement productively  
- Using AI to explore interpretations, not resolve uncertainty  
- Avoiding narrative lock-in driven by pattern detection  

---

### `prioritisation-and-trade-offs-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **strategic prioritisation under constraint**.

Focuses on:
- Making trade-offs explicit and defensible  
- Avoiding optimisation narratives that hide value judgements  
- Integrating ethics, equity, and long-term impact into prioritisation  

---

### `change-management-meetings-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **change management and transformation meetings**.

Focuses on:
- Using AI to support listening and coordination, not control  
- Protecting trust, empathy, and legitimacy during change  
- Avoiding technocratic or depersonalised change narratives

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended approach:

1. Select the scenario aligned to your leadership context  
2. Use the scenario to frame discussion before decisions are made  
3. Work deliberately through the six framework domains  
4. Apply AI prompts cautiously and transparently  
5. Document assumptions, uncertainties, and trade-offs  
6. Revisit learning as strategy or conditions evolve  

These scenarios are designed to support **ongoing strategic capability**, not one-off decision events.

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

This folder focuses on **leadership-level sensemaking and strategic judgement**.

Related but distinct folders include:

- **Governance and Decision-Making**  
  Focuses on formal approval, accountability, and risk processes.

- **Meetings and Collaboration**  
  Covers facilitation and decision practices at an operational or team level.

- **Research and Knowledge Work**  
  Addresses epistemic and analytical contexts rather than strategic direction.

The separation helps maintain clarity between **strategic leadership responsibility** and **operational or analytical AI use**.
