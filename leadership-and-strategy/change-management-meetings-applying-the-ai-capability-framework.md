## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports change management meetings where leaders and teams plan, communicate, and steer organisational change. These meetings often address restructuring, process redesign, digital transformation, or cultural shifts, and they are characterised by uncertainty, emotion, and uneven power.

AI is increasingly introduced into change contexts to analyse sentiment, summarise feedback, draft communications, or model impacts. While these uses can support coordination and clarity, they also risk depersonalising change, amplifying managerial bias, or creating the illusion of control.

The purpose of this scenario is to help leaders use AI as a support for listening, sensemaking, and communication, while ensuring that responsibility, empathy, and legitimacy remain firmly human.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Senior leaders and change sponsors  
- Line managers and team leads  
- HR, OD, and transformation professionals  
- Facilitators of change processes  

---

## 2. Situation and Context

A change management meeting is convened to:

- introduce or explain a change initiative  
- coordinate implementation steps  
- surface concerns, risks, or resistance  
- align leadership and management messages  

These meetings often involve:

- heightened emotion and anxiety  
- information asymmetry  
- pressure to maintain momentum  

AI may be used to synthesise feedback, draft messages, or predict impacts. How it is used will shape trust, engagement, and the perceived legitimacy of the change.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in change management meetings to:

- summarise staff feedback or consultation responses  
- analyse themes or sentiment across inputs  
- draft change communications or FAQs  
- model timelines or dependencies  

These uses matter because:

- sentiment analysis can oversimplify lived experience  
- drafted messages may sound authoritative but impersonal  
- predictive models can underplay human response  

This scenario treats AI use in change management as **medium- to high-risk**, particularly where morale, trust, and inclusion are at stake.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, leaders should clarify:

- the nature and scope of the change  
- what is known, unknown, and undecided  
- whose experiences and perspectives matter most  

Key awareness questions:

- Are we using AI to listen or to manage perception?  
- What emotions or concerns might data obscure?  
- Where is honesty more important than reassurance?  

AI should be used to surface insight, not to mask uncertainty.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In change management:

- humans remain responsible for judgement, care, and communication  
- AI may assist with organisation and synthesis  

Good co-agency means:

- leaders set the tone and narrative  
- AI outputs are interpreted with empathy  
- decisions about pace and messaging remain human  

Avoid:

- delegating emotional labour to AI  
- using AI outputs to justify predetermined decisions  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:

- identifying recurring themes in feedback for discussion  
- drafting multiple versions of messages for review  
- mapping dependencies to support planning  

Inappropriate uses include:

- predicting individual reactions or resistance  
- automating change communications without review  
- using AI to monitor or profile staff sentiment  

AI should support understanding and coordination, not control.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity and Impact

Change processes have uneven impacts.

Use the Framework to ask:

- Who is most affected by this change?  
- Are some groups bearing disproportionate risk?  
- Does AI use amplify or diminish marginal voices?  

Ethical change management requires attention to power, voice, and care.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making and Governance

Good governance practices include:

- clarity about what is decided versus consultative  
- transparency about how feedback informs decisions  
- documentation of key trade-offs and risks  

If AI is used:

- record its role in synthesis or drafting  
- ensure human sign-off on communications  
- avoid creating opaque decision trails  

This supports trust and accountability during change.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning and Renewal

After change meetings, reflect:

- Did AI use support listening and understanding?  
- Where did it risk flattening or misrepresenting experience?  
- How should AI be used differently as change progresses?  

Reflection helps organisations learn how to manage change more humanely.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts and Checks

### Human reflection prompts

- What concerns are we hearing but not addressing?  
- Where might people feel unheard or unsafe?  
- Are we being honest about uncertainty?  

### Optional AI prompts

- “Summarise staff feedback, highlighting areas of concern without assigning sentiment scores.”  
- “Draft alternative versions of this message with different tones for review.”  

### Pause and check

- Is AI helping us listen better, or just respond faster?  
- Would this approach build trust if we were on the receiving end?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following change management meetings:

- Did actions reflect what was discussed?  
- How did people respond to communications?  
- What capability gaps have become visible?  

Use insights to adapt change strategy and support mechanisms.

---

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations to:

- manage change with greater empathy and legitimacy  
- avoid technocratic or AI-driven change narratives  
- support meaningful consultation and communication  
- strengthen trust during periods of uncertainty  
- build mature, human-centred AI capability in leadership contexts
