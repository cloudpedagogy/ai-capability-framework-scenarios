## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports strategy awaydays and extended leadership sessions where organisations step back from day-to-day operations to reflect, align, and set direction. These moments are often used to explore future priorities, respond to uncertainty, and make high-level strategic choices.

AI is increasingly introduced into strategy awaydays to generate scenarios, synthesise evidence, surface trends, or stimulate new ideas. While this can enrich discussion, it also risks overconfidence, premature convergence, or the illusion of foresight if AI outputs are treated as authoritative.

The purpose of this scenario is to help leaders use AI as a structured sensemaking and exploration aid, while ensuring that strategic judgement, values, and accountability remain firmly human.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Senior leadership teams  
- Strategy and planning leads  
- Board members and governors  
- Facilitators of strategic planning processes  

---

## 2. Situation and Context

A strategy awayday is convened to:

- review organisational direction  
- respond to external change or disruption  
- set medium- to long-term priorities  
- align leadership perspectives  

These sessions often involve:

- incomplete or ambiguous information  
- competing narratives about the future  
- pressure to demonstrate clarity and confidence  

AI may be used to summarise trends, generate scenarios, or provoke discussion. How it is used will shape whether the session enables genuine strategic thinking or reinforces existing assumptions.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in strategy awaydays to:

- synthesise environmental scans or horizon-scanning outputs  
- generate alternative future scenarios  
- summarise stakeholder feedback or performance data  
- prompt ideation and challenge thinking  

These uses matter because:

- AI-generated scenarios can feel deceptively authoritative  
- pattern recognition may privilege dominant data sources  
- ideation prompts can steer thinking subtly but powerfully  

This scenario treats AI use in strategy awaydays as **medium-risk but high-influence**, requiring careful facilitation and explicit framing.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, leaders should clarify:

- the purpose of the awayday (explore, decide, align)  
- the level of uncertainty being acknowledged  
- which assumptions are open to challenge  

Key awareness questions:

- Are we seeking insight or reassurance?  
- What uncertainties do we need to hold open?  
- Where might AI outputs narrow rather than expand thinking?  

AI should be used to open up possibilities, not to close debate prematurely.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In strategic contexts:

- humans remain responsible for strategic direction  
- AI may act as a stimulus or analytical lens  

Good co-agency means:

- leaders frame questions and scenarios intentionally  
- AI outputs are treated as provisional  
- facilitators actively manage how AI influences discussion  

Avoid:

- deferring strategic judgement to AI-generated futures  
- using AI to legitimise predetermined decisions  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:

- generating multiple contrasting future scenarios  
- summarising complex evidence for discussion  
- provoking alternative perspectives or questions  

Inappropriate uses include:

- selecting strategic priorities automatically  
- ranking strategic options without deliberation  
- presenting AI outputs as predictions  

AI should support strategic conversation, not replace it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity and Impact

Strategic decisions shape long-term impact.

Use the Framework to ask:

- Who benefits or loses from proposed directions?  
- Whose voices are missing from strategic narratives?  
- Could AI-informed strategies reinforce inequity or exclusion?  

Ethical strategy requires attention to distribution of impact, not just organisational advantage.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making and Governance

Good governance in strategy awaydays includes:

- clarity about which decisions are binding  
- separation of exploration from formal approval  
- documentation of strategic rationale  

If AI is used:

- record its role in informing discussion  
- ensure final strategic commitments are human-endorsed  
- avoid opaque decision trails  

This supports accountability and trust.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning and Renewal

After the awayday, reflect:

- Did AI use expand or constrain strategic thinking?  
- Where did discussion feel most generative or fragile?  
- How should AI be used differently next time?  

Reflection supports strategic learning, not just output generation.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts and Checks

### Human reflection prompts

- What assumptions are we least willing to challenge?  
- What futures make us uncomfortable — and why?  
- Are we confusing plausibility with desirability?  

### Optional AI prompts

- “Generate three contrasting future scenarios based on different assumptions.”  
- “Summarise key external trends while noting uncertainty and disagreement.”  

### Pause and check

- Is AI helping us think more deeply, or just faster?  
- Are we still exercising collective strategic judgement?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following the awayday:

- Were strategic priorities clearly articulated?  
- Did AI use influence confidence or consensus?  
- What learning should inform the next strategic cycle?  

Ensure insights feed into formal planning and review processes.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations to:

- use AI to enrich strategic sensemaking  
- avoid false certainty and AI-driven overconfidence  
- surface assumptions and values explicitly  
- strengthen accountability in strategic direction-setting  
- build mature, reflective AI capability at leadership level
