# Meetings and Collaboration — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on meetings, collaboration, and collective work where AI may shape discussion, sensemaking, decisions, and follow-through.

Meetings are one of the most common — and most underestimated — sites of AI influence. Subtle uses of AI in preparation, live support, summarisation, and follow-up can reshape power dynamics, anchor decisions prematurely, or blur accountability if not used deliberately.

These scenarios help teams use AI to **support collaboration without undermining judgement, participation, or trust**.

---

## Who This Set Is For

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Meeting chairs and facilitators  
- Committee members and governance officers  
- Project and programme leads  
- Academic and professional services staff  
- Teams working in hybrid, digital, or high-volume meeting environments  

They are suitable for routine meetings, governance forums, workshops, and collaborative decision-making contexts.

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios are:

- Practical, meeting-centred applications of the AI Capability Framework  
- Focused on real collaborative moments, not abstract policy  
- Explicitly mapped to all six framework domains  
- Designed to protect agency, inclusion, and accountability  
- Usable as preparation guides, facilitation aids, or reflective tools  

### These scenarios are not:

- Productivity hacks or meeting-automation recipes  
- AI-first facilitation models  
- Replacements for good chairing or facilitation  
- Tools for monitoring or managing people through AI

## Scenarios in This Folder

### `meeting-preparation-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **preparing for meetings** where AI may be used to summarise materials, draft agendas, or frame discussion.

Focuses on:
- Using AI to support readiness without pre-determining outcomes  
- Designing agendas that enable fair participation  
- Avoiding bias introduced through pre-framed summaries or questions  

---

### `live-meeting-support-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **AI use during live meetings**.

Focuses on:
- Protecting psychological safety and participation  
- Preventing AI from anchoring discussion or conclusions  
- Keeping AI as background support, not a decision-maker  

---

### `decision-capture-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **accurate and accountable capture of decisions**.

Focuses on:
- Distinguishing decisions from discussion  
- Preserving dissent, conditions, and uncertainty  
- Avoiding AI inference about intent or agreement  

---

### `follow-up-and-action-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **turning decisions into action** after meetings.

Focuses on:
- Maintaining clear human ownership of actions  
- Using AI to reduce friction, not create surveillance  
- Proportional tracking and transparent follow-through

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended workflow:

1. Before meetings → use *Meeting Preparation*  
2. During meetings → draw on *Live Meeting Support*  
3. At closure → apply *Decision Capture*  
4. After meetings → use *Follow-Up and Action*  
5. Periodically → reflect on patterns and capability growth  

These scenarios can be used individually or combined to support **end-to-end meeting practice**.

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

This folder focuses on **collaborative process and facilitation**.

Related but distinct folders include:

- **Leadership and Strategy**  
  Focuses on strategic direction, prioritisation, and sensemaking under uncertainty.

- **Governance and Decision-Making**  
  Covers formal accountability, risk review, and approval structures.

- **Teaching and Facilitation**  
  Addresses learning-focused contexts rather than organisational collaboration.

The separation ensures clarity between **how people work together** and **what authority or outcomes are involved**.
