## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports the use of AI during meetings while they are taking place — a moment where collaboration, sensemaking, and decision-making happen in real time.

Live meetings are one of the most tempting contexts for AI use: summarising discussion on the fly, capturing action points, clarifying complex information, or prompting next questions. At the same time, this is a high-risk moment for overreach, distraction, power imbalance, and loss of human agency.

The purpose of this scenario is to help professionals use AI, if at all, as a quiet support to human facilitation, while protecting psychological safety, equitable participation, and accountable decision-making.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Meeting chairs and facilitators  
- Committee members  
- Project and programme leads  
- Academic and professional services staff  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

A meeting is in progress. Participants are:
- sharing perspectives  
- responding to one another  
- negotiating priorities  
- forming judgements collectively  

Typical pressures during live meetings include:
- limited time  
- dominant voices  
- cognitive overload  
- pressure to reach conclusions  

AI may be present as a live note-taker, summarisation tool, or decision-support aid. How and whether it is used will shape the tone, trust, and outcomes of the meeting.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used during meetings to:
- capture notes or discussion themes  
- summarise points of agreement or tension  
- surface unanswered questions  
- support facilitation prompts  

These uses matter because:
- real-time summaries can anchor discussion prematurely  
- participants may defer to AI outputs  
- live AI use can shift power dynamics  

This scenario treats AI use in live meetings as **high-risk and high-impact**, requiring explicit boundaries and consent.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before and during AI use, be clear about:
- the purpose of the meeting (discussion, decision, exploration)  
- what level of openness and debate is desired  
- how participants understand AI’s role  

Key awareness questions:
- Will AI support or disrupt the flow of discussion?  
- Could its presence silence some voices?  
- Is this meeting appropriate for live AI use at all?  

Sometimes, the most responsible choice is **not** to use AI.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In live meetings:
- humans must remain the agents of dialogue and decision  
- AI may assist with background support only  

Good co-agency means:
- the chair controls when and how AI is used  
- AI outputs do not direct discussion  
- participants can question or ignore AI-generated summaries  

Avoid:
- allowing AI to frame conclusions  
- treating AI outputs as neutral or authoritative  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- capturing neutral notes for later review  
- listing questions or unresolved issues  
- supporting facilitators with time or agenda prompts  

Inappropriate uses include:
- real-time decision recommendations  
- ranking options or viewpoints  
- generating conclusions during discussion  

AI should remain **background infrastructure**, not a participant.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Live AI use can affect equity and inclusion.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Are all participants comfortable with AI being used?  
- Does AI use privilege faster speakers or clearer articulation?  
- Are quieter contributions being captured fairly?  

Ethical facilitation prioritises psychological safety and trust.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Strong governance practices include:
- explicit agreement about AI use at the start of the meeting  
- clarity on what outputs will be retained  
- separation of discussion records from decision records  

If AI is used:
- note its role in the meeting record  
- avoid relying solely on AI-generated notes  

This supports transparency and accountability.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After the meeting, reflect:
- Did AI support or constrain discussion?  
- How did participants respond to its presence?  
- Should AI be used differently next time?  

Reflection helps teams develop context-sensitive AI judgement.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- Are we still listening to one another?  
- Is any voice dominating — human or AI?  
- Do we need to slow down or pause?  

**Optional AI prompts**
- “List unresolved questions raised so far without prioritising them.”  
- “Summarise points of agreement and disagreement neutrally.”  

**Pause & check**
- Is AI helping collaboration right now?  
- Would turning it off improve the discussion?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following the meeting:
- Did AI use feel proportionate and appropriate?  
- Where did it add value?  
- Where did it create friction or distraction?  

Use insights to guide future facilitation choices.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- support live collaboration without undermining agency  
- avoid over-reliance on AI during discussion  
- protect inclusion and psychological safety  
- strengthen facilitation and decision quality  
- develop mature, context-aware AI capability
