## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports preparing for meetings where decisions, collaboration, or sensemaking will take place. It focuses on how agendas, materials, questions, and expectations are shaped before people come together — a stage that strongly influences the quality of discussion and the fairness of participation.

Meetings are a common entry point for AI use: summarising background papers, drafting agendas, suggesting discussion questions, or pre-reading synthesis. Used well, AI can reduce cognitive load and improve focus. Used poorly, it can pre-shape outcomes, narrow perspectives, or privilege certain voices.

The purpose of this scenario is to help professionals use AI to support readiness and inclusion, while ensuring that meetings remain spaces for human judgement, dialogue, and shared decision-making.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Meeting chairs and facilitators  
- Team leads and project managers  
- Committee members  
- Academic and professional services staff

## 2. Situation & Context

A meeting is being planned. It may involve:
- routine coordination  
- collaborative problem-solving  
- governance or approval  
- strategic discussion  

Typical constraints include:
- limited preparation time  
- uneven access to background information  
- large or cross-disciplinary groups  
- competing priorities and fatigue  

At this stage, choices about what information is shared, how issues are framed, and what questions are posed will shape who participates confidently and how decisions unfold.

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI is commonly used in meeting preparation to:
- summarise background documents  
- draft or refine agendas  
- generate discussion questions  
- identify key themes or tensions  

These uses matter because:
- summaries can foreground some issues over others  
- agenda structure can privilege certain viewpoints  
- pre-framed questions may constrain discussion  

This scenario treats AI use in meeting preparation as **medium-risk but high-leverage**, requiring intentional framing and review.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, clarify:
- the purpose of the meeting (inform, decide, explore, align)  
- what participants need to arrive prepared  
- where open discussion is essential  

Key awareness questions:
- What kind of thinking does this meeting require?  
- What should not be pre-determined?  
- Who might need additional context or support?  

AI should be used to support readiness, not to pre-empt outcomes.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In meeting preparation:
- humans define the intent and tone of the meeting  
- AI may assist with organisation and clarity  

Good co-agency means:
- agendas are human-authored and owned  
- AI-generated materials are reviewed and adjusted  
- facilitators remain accountable for framing  

Avoid:
- allowing AI to define decision options  
- delegating prioritisation without scrutiny  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- producing neutral summaries of background materials  
- drafting agenda structures for discussion  
- generating multiple question framings for review  

Inappropriate uses include:
- generating conclusions or recommendations  
- scripting discussion outcomes  
- filtering out minority perspectives  

AI outputs should act as starting points, not constraints.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Meeting preparation has equity implications.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Does preparation privilege those already confident or informed?  
- Are materials accessible and inclusive?  
- Does AI summarisation risk silencing complexity or dissent?  

Ethical preparation supports fair participation, not efficiency alone.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:
- clarity about which items are for discussion vs decision  
- transparency about how materials were prepared  
- appropriate records of agenda-setting  

If AI is used:
- note its role in preparing materials  
- ensure summaries do not replace original documents where scrutiny is required  

This supports trust and accountability.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After preparation, reflect:
- Did preparation enable meaningful participation?  
- Were expectations clear?  
- How might preparation be improved next time?  

Learning at this stage improves meetings systemically.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What do participants need most to engage well?  
- Are we over-framing the discussion?  
- What perspectives might be missing?  

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Summarise these documents neutrally, highlighting areas of uncertainty or disagreement.”  
- “Draft an agenda that distinguishes clearly between discussion and decision items.”  

**Pause & check**
- Would participants recognise this framing as fair?  
- Are we using AI to support participation, not control it?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

After the meeting:
- Did preparation support productive discussion?  
- Where did participants seem under-prepared or constrained?  
- How did AI use affect the meeting dynamic?  

Capture learning to improve future meeting preparation.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- prepare meetings more intentionally  
- reduce cognitive overload for participants  
- support inclusive and meaningful participation  
- use AI responsibly without pre-determining outcomes  
- strengthen collaborative decision-making practices
