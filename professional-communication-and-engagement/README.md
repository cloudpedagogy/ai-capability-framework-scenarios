# Professional Communication and Engagement  
**Applying the AI Capability Framework**

This folder contains scenario-based guides for applying the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** to professional communication and engagement contexts where AI may shape messaging, framing, interpretation, or public trust.

These scenarios address moments where communication is not merely informational, but **consequential** — influencing reputation, relationships, legitimacy, and decision-making across organisational, public, and stakeholder-facing contexts.

AI is increasingly used to draft, adapt, summarise, or optimise communication. These scenarios help professionals use AI **responsibly, proportionately, and defensibly**, without eroding judgement, credibility, or care.

## What this folder is for

Professional communication and engagement contexts include situations where:

- messages carry reputational or ethical weight
- audiences have different levels of power, expertise, or vulnerability
- accuracy, tone, and proportionality matter as much as clarity
- AI-generated outputs may appear confident, persuasive, or authoritative

This folder supports AI-aware practice in contexts such as:

- internal and external communications
- stakeholder and partner engagement
- public-facing explanations of decisions or evidence
- policy, strategy, or research communication
- sensitive or high-risk messaging

---

## Who this is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Communications and engagement teams  
- Policy, strategy, and public affairs professionals  
- Researchers and leaders communicating findings or decisions  
- Educators and facilitators supporting AI-aware communication practice  
- Governance, risk, and assurance roles concerned with reputational impact  

They assume **no technical AI expertise**, but do assume responsibility for judgement and accountability.

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Facilitation-ready, Markdown-based guides  
- Grounded in realistic professional situations  
- Explicitly aligned to all six AI Capability Framework domains  
- Designed to surface judgement, ethics, and trade-offs  
- Suitable for workshops, team reflection, and guided discussion  

### These scenarios are not:

- Copywriting templates or prompt packs  
- Marketing optimisation playbooks  
- Tool-specific communication guides  
- Automation instructions for mass messaging  

They focus on **how to think and decide**, not how to generate content faster.

## Relationship to other folders

This folder complements — but does not duplicate — other scenario sets:

- **Leadership and strategy** focuses on internal direction-setting  
- **Governance and decision-making** focuses on formal accountability  
- **Research and knowledge work** focuses on evidence production  

**Professional communication and engagement** focuses on:

> How AI shapes *meaning, interpretation, trust, and legitimacy* once ideas, decisions, or evidence leave the room.

## Example scenario types in this folder

Scenarios in this folder may include (examples):

- Public-facing communication of complex or uncertain information  
- AI-assisted drafting of sensitive announcements  
- Stakeholder engagement under reputational risk  
- Communicating policy or strategy decisions transparently  
- Explaining AI-influenced decisions to non-technical audiences  
- Crisis or issue communications where AI is present or visible  

Each scenario demonstrates how to apply the AI Capability Framework **in context**, not abstractly.

## How to use these scenarios

A recommended pattern:

1. Select a scenario aligned to your communication context  
2. Read the situation and risks collectively  
3. Work through the six framework domains  
4. Discuss boundaries for appropriate AI use  
5. Capture learning and decision rationale  
6. Adapt language and prompts for your organisation  

Scenarios may be used:

- in communications team workshops  
- as part of leadership or governance training  
- to support policy or engagement design  
- as reflective tools following real communication events  

---

## Design principles

All scenarios in this folder are guided by the following principles:

- Human judgement remains central  
- AI outputs are provisional, not authoritative  
- Ethics, equity, and impact are surfaced explicitly  
- Communication is treated as a **governance act**, not just delivery  
- Learning and reflection are built into practice
