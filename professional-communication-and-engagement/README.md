# Professional Communication and Engagement — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on professional communication, engagement, and public-facing interaction.

These scenarios address moments where AI may shape how organisations communicate, listen, respond, and represent themselves — often in contexts where trust, legitimacy, and ethical responsibility matter as much as efficiency or clarity.

The scenarios are designed to support **responsible, human-centred communication practices** when AI is present, permitted, or under consideration.

## Who this scenario set is for

This folder is designed for professionals working in roles such as:

- Communications, engagement, and public affairs teams  
- Policy, consultation, and stakeholder engagement staff  
- Leaders and managers responsible for public trust  
- Researchers and educators engaging external audiences  
- Professionals handling media, reputation, or sensitive dialogue  

The scenarios are suitable for individual reflection, team discussion, workshops, and governance-aware training.

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Context-rich, facilitation-ready guides  
- Grounded in realistic professional situations  
- Explicitly mapped to all six AI Capability Framework domains  
- Designed to support judgement, accountability, and reflection  
- Usable across education, research, public service, and mission-driven organisations  

### These scenarios are not:

- Media training manuals or PR playbooks  
- Tool-specific AI prompting guides  
- Automation recipes for communication workflows  
- Reputation-management or persuasion frameworks  

They sit **between policy and practice**, supporting thoughtful action where AI intersects with communication, power, and trust.

## Scenarios in this folder

This folder currently includes:

- **Stakeholder Engagement and Consultation**  
  Applying the Framework to consultations, listening exercises, and structured engagement where legitimacy and voice are central.

- **Media Engagement and Press Interaction**  
  Supporting responsible AI use in press relations, public statements, and reputationally sensitive communication.

- **Community Outreach and Public Dialogue**  
  Addressing AI use in public-facing dialogue, community engagement, and contexts involving lived experience and unequal power.

Each scenario follows a consistent structure:
1. Purpose and context  
2. Where AI may appear — and why it matters  
3. Application of all six Framework domains  
4. In-the-moment prompts and checks  
5. After-action reflection and learning

## How to use this scenario set

A recommended approach:

1. **Select** a scenario aligned to your communication context  
2. **Adapt** language and examples to local culture and policy  
3. **Use** the scenario to structure discussion or preparation  
4. **Reflect** on judgement, ethics, and impact — not just outputs  
5. **Iterate** and document learning for future engagements  

Scenarios can be used:
- in communications planning meetings  
- during engagement design or review  
- as part of CPD or leadership development  
- to support governance or reputational risk discussions

## Relationship to other scenario folders

This folder focuses on **external-facing communication and engagement**.

Related but distinct scenario sets include:
- **Meetings and Collaboration** — internal coordination and decision-making  
- **Leadership and Strategy** — strategic direction and organisational sensemaking  
- **Governance and Decision-Making** — formal accountability and oversight  
- **Teaching and Facilitation** — learning-focused interaction  

Together, these folders provide coverage across internal, external, and hybrid communication contexts.

## Design principles

All scenarios in this folder are built around shared principles:

- Human judgement remains central  
- AI use is explicit, bounded, and contestable  
- Listening is prioritised over optimisation  
- Power, equity, and legitimacy are surfaced  
- Reflection and renewal are integral, not optional
