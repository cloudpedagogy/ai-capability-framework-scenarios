## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports community outreach and public dialogue activities where organisations engage with communities, publics, or stakeholder groups beyond formal institutional boundaries.

Examples include:
- public consultations or listening exercises  
- community forums or town-hall style events  
- engagement with service users, patients, learners, or local partners  
- dialogue around controversial, sensitive, or value-laden issues  

AI is increasingly introduced into outreach and dialogue contexts to summarise feedback, analyse themes, draft responses, or prepare engagement materials. While these uses can support scale and organisation, they also risk flattening lived experience, misrepresenting sentiment, or shifting dialogue from relationship-building to data extraction.

The purpose of this scenario is to help organisations use AI, if at all, to support respectful, inclusive, and accountable public engagement — while ensuring that listening, trust, and legitimacy remain fundamentally human.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Engagement and communications teams  
- Community liaison and outreach staff  
- Researchers and educators working with publics  
- Leaders responsible for public trust and legitimacy  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

A community outreach or public dialogue activity is being planned, delivered, or reviewed. These contexts are characterised by:
- diverse perspectives and lived experiences  
- uneven power and voice  
- historical or contextual sensitivities  
- expectations of sincerity and accountability  

Participants may bring:
- strong emotions or personal experience  
- scepticism about institutional motives  
- concerns about whether their input will matter  

AI may be proposed to help “manage” scale or complexity. How it is used will shape whether engagement feels authentic or extractive.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in community outreach to:
- summarise feedback or consultation responses  
- cluster themes across large numbers of inputs  
- draft reports or response summaries  
- prepare briefing materials for facilitators  

These uses matter because:
- summarisation can erase minority or marginal voices  
- thematic clustering may privilege dominant narratives  
- AI framing can subtly re-interpret lived experience  

This scenario treats AI use in community engagement as **medium- to high-risk**, particularly where trust is fragile or contested.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, teams should clarify:
- the purpose of the engagement (listening, informing, deciding)  
- how community input will be used  
- what commitments are being made  

Key awareness questions:
- Are we genuinely listening, or only documenting?
- Whose voices are easiest to hear — and whose are not?
- Where could AI abstraction distort meaning?

AI should be used to support attentiveness, not distance.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In public dialogue:
- humans remain responsible for interpretation and response  
- AI may assist with organisation, not meaning-making  

Good co-agency means:
- communities are not reduced to “data”  
- AI outputs are reviewed critically and collectively  
- final interpretations are human-authored and owned  

Avoid:
- presenting AI summaries as neutral truth  
- outsourcing sensemaking about lived experience  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- organising feedback with explicit uncertainty markers  
- identifying questions that require deeper human engagement  
- supporting transparency in reporting processes  

Inappropriate uses include:
- sentiment scoring of personal testimony  
- filtering out “outlier” views for convenience  
- automating responses to community input  

AI should support dialogue, not replace it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Community engagement is ethically charged.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Who is most affected by decisions linked to this engagement?
- Are some voices being translated more faithfully than others?
- Could AI use reinforce institutional power over community voice?

Ethical outreach prioritises respect, inclusion, and accountability.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:
- clarity about how community input informs decisions  
- transparency about limits of influence  
- appropriate retention and use of engagement records  

If AI is used:
- explain its role openly where appropriate  
- avoid opaque synthesis processes  
- ensure accountability for interpretations and responses  

This supports legitimacy and public trust.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After outreach activities, reflect:
- Did AI use deepen understanding or flatten it?
- Where did engagement feel most authentic?
- What should change in future dialogue design?

Reflection supports relational capability, not just reporting.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- Are we truly hearing what is being said?
- What discomfort or disagreement are we tempted to smooth over?
- Where do we need to slow down?

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Summarise these responses while explicitly noting divergence and tension.”
- “Highlight questions raised that require further dialogue, not synthesis.”

**Pause & check**
- Does this use of AI honour people’s lived experience?
- Would participants recognise themselves in this summary?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following outreach or dialogue:
- How did participants respond to the process?
- Were commitments honoured and communicated?
- How should AI use be governed next time?

Feed insights into engagement policy, training, and facilitation practice.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- engage communities with care and credibility  
- avoid extractive or technocratic engagement practices  
- use AI to support, not substitute, listening  
- strengthen public trust and legitimacy  
- build mature AI capability in public-facing contexts
