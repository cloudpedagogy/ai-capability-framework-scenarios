# Public-Facing Communication Under Uncertainty: Applying the AI Capability Framework

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports public-facing communication where uncertainty is genuine and unavoidable — such as emerging evidence, incomplete analysis, contested interpretations, or evolving situations.

These moments are high-stakes. Communications shape public understanding, trust, legitimacy, and downstream decision-making. Pressure often exists to sound confident, decisive, and reassuring — even when certainty is not yet justified.

AI is increasingly introduced into these contexts to draft statements, simplify complex information, generate FAQs, or tailor messages for different audiences. While this can improve clarity and speed, it also risks **false certainty**, **over-smoothing of disagreement**, or **authoritative tone without epistemic warrant**.

The purpose of this scenario is to help professionals use AI, if at all, to support responsible public communication **without collapsing uncertainty, obscuring judgement, or overstating confidence**.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Communications and engagement teams  
- Policy and public affairs professionals  
- Research leaders and knowledge-exchange teams  
- Senior leaders responsible for public statements  
- Governance, risk, and assurance roles

## 2. Situation & Context

A public communication is required in a context where:

- evidence is incomplete, emerging, or contested  
- outcomes are uncertain or still evolving  
- public interest, scrutiny, or concern is high  

Examples include:

- early research findings or preliminary analysis  
- responses to emerging risks or incidents  
- policy positions under development  
- organisational decisions made under uncertainty  

Typical pressures include:

- demand for clear answers  
- fear of reputational damage  
- media or stakeholder time pressure  
- internal disagreement about framing  

AI may be proposed to accelerate drafting, harmonise messaging, or “make it sound confident”. How it is used will shape whether communication builds **trust through honesty** or undermines it through **manufactured certainty**.

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in public-facing communication to:

- draft statements, press releases, or web content  
- summarise complex or technical material  
- generate FAQs or anticipated questions  
- tailor tone or length for different audiences  

These uses matter because:

- AI tends to resolve ambiguity rather than hold it  
- generated language often sounds confident and final  
- uncertainty may be reframed as reassurance  
- minority or dissenting views may disappear  

This scenario treats AI use in public communication under uncertainty as **medium- to high-risk**, with significant reputational and ethical implications.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, teams should clarify:

- what is genuinely known, unknown, and undecided  
- where uncertainty must be retained explicitly  
- what audiences need — and what they are entitled to  

Key awareness questions:

- Are we communicating understanding or confidence?  
- Where would precision be misleading?  
- What uncertainty are we ethically obliged to disclose?  

AI should be used to **support articulation**, not to remove uncertainty for comfort.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In public communication:

- humans remain responsible for truthfulness, framing, and tone  
- AI may assist with drafting or structuring language  

Good co-agency means:

- humans define what must remain uncertain  
- AI outputs are reviewed for tone, implication, and overreach  
- final messaging decisions are explicitly human  

Avoid:

- allowing AI to “resolve” ambiguity  
- treating fluent language as epistemic authority  
- outsourcing reputational judgement to tools  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:

- drafting multiple alternative versions for comparison  
- simplifying language while preserving caveats  
- supporting internal discussion about framing choices  

Inappropriate uses include:

- removing uncertainty to improve readability  
- generating authoritative conclusions without evidence  
- producing final public statements without review  

AI should support **careful communication**, not closure.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public communication under uncertainty has ethical consequences.

Use the Framework to ask:

- Who may be affected by how uncertainty is framed?  
- Could reassurance delay necessary caution or action?  
- Are some audiences more vulnerable to misinterpretation?  

Ethical communication prioritises **honesty, proportionality, and care**, even when this feels uncomfortable.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:

- clarity about who approves public messaging  
- documentation of assumptions and limitations  
- alignment with organisational risk and assurance processes  

If AI is used:

- record its role in drafting or summarisation  
- ensure human sign-off on all public outputs  
- avoid opaque or automated publishing pipelines  

This supports accountability if communications are later challenged.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After public communication, reflect:

- Did we communicate uncertainty responsibly?  
- How was the message interpreted externally?  
- Did AI use help or hinder trust?  

Reflection strengthens organisational capability to communicate under pressure — not just in hindsight.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**

- What are we most uncertain about right now?  
- What might audiences wrongly infer from this wording?  
- Are we prioritising reassurance over accuracy?  

**Optional AI prompts**

- “Draft two versions of this message: one maximally cautious, one minimally cautious — without changing facts.”  
- “Identify statements that imply certainty without evidence.”  

**Pause & check**

- Would we defend this framing publicly in six months?  
- Are we comfortable owning every implication of this message?  

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following publication or release:

- Did the communication align with actual knowledge?  
- Were misunderstandings or misinterpretations evident?  
- How should future communications change?  

Capture learning to refine communication practices, not just outputs.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:

- communicate uncertainty without losing credibility  
- avoid AI-driven false confidence  
- strengthen public trust through transparency  
- support ethical and accountable messaging  
- build mature AI capability in high-visibility contexts
