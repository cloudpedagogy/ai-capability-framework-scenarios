# Public Statements and Official Communications: Applying the AI Capability Framework

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports the drafting and approval of public statements and official communications issued by organisations, institutions, or senior leaders. These communications may address policy positions, organisational changes, incidents, research findings, or responses to external scrutiny.

Public statements carry institutional authority. When AI is used to draft, refine, or adapt such communications, there is a risk that language becomes overly confident, generic, or detached from organisational accountability. Misuse can undermine trust, obscure responsibility, or create governance risk.

The purpose of this scenario is to help professionals use AI, if at all, as a bounded drafting aid, while ensuring that institutional voice, accountability, and ethical responsibility remain explicitly human.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Senior leaders and executives  
- Communications and public affairs teams  
- Policy and governance officers  
- Academic and professional services leaders  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

An organisation is preparing to issue an official statement. This may relate to:
- a policy decision or strategic direction  
- an organisational change or announcement  
- a public response to criticism or concern  
- clarification of position following external events  

At this stage:
- wording carries legal, reputational, and ethical weight  
- statements may be scrutinised internally and externally  
- attribution, tone, and precision matter  

AI may be proposed to help draft or refine language quickly, particularly under time pressure. How AI is used will shape whether the statement is experienced as responsible and trustworthy or evasive and formulaic.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in public statements to:
- draft initial versions of text  
- rewrite for tone, clarity, or consistency  
- shorten or adapt statements for different channels  
- identify ambiguities or unintended implications  

These uses matter because:
- AI-generated language can imply certainty where none exists  
- tone optimisation may dilute accountability  
- generic phrasing can obscure organisational responsibility  

This scenario treats AI use in official communications as **high-risk**, requiring strict human oversight and governance.

---

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, teams should clarify:
- the purpose and audience of the statement  
- what is known, uncertain, or still evolving  
- what commitments or implications the statement carries  

Key awareness questions:
- What are we accountable for in this communication?
- Where must uncertainty or limitation be made explicit?
- How might AI-generated language overstate confidence?

AI should not be used to smooth over ambiguity or risk.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In official communications:
- humans remain the authors and owners of institutional voice  
- AI may assist with drafting or refinement only  

Good co-agency means:
- final wording is explicitly approved by accountable humans  
- AI outputs are treated as drafts, not authoritative text  
- responsibility for content is clearly attributed  

Avoid:
- publishing AI-generated text without human validation  
- allowing AI to define tone or positioning implicitly  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- generating alternative draft phrasings for review  
- identifying unclear or potentially misleading wording  
- checking consistency across related communications  

Inappropriate uses include:
- generating final statements automatically  
- removing caveats or nuance to improve clarity  
- reframing responsibility away from the organisation  

AI should support precision and reflection, not reputational shielding.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public statements can have wide-reaching consequences.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Who may be affected by how this is communicated?
- Does the language minimise harm or responsibility?
- Could certain groups feel dismissed, blamed, or excluded?

Ethical communication prioritises honesty, care, and proportionality.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:
- clear approval pathways for public statements  
- documentation of decision rationale and revisions  
- alignment with legal, regulatory, and ethical obligations  

If AI is used:
- its role in drafting should be recorded internally  
- human sign-off must be explicit  
- draft versions should be retained where appropriate  

This supports accountability and defensibility if challenged.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After issuing a statement, reflect:
- Did the communication achieve its intended purpose?
- Where did wording generate confusion or concern?
- How did AI use influence tone or clarity?

Reflection strengthens institutional communication capability over time.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- Are we clearly owning what is ours to own?
- What might a sceptical reader infer from this wording?
- Where should we be more explicit about uncertainty?

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Identify language that may imply certainty beyond available evidence.”
- “Rewrite this paragraph to increase clarity without reducing accountability.”

**Pause & check**
- Would we stand by this wording under scrutiny?
- Is AI helping us communicate responsibly, or defensively?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

After publication:
- How was the statement received internally and externally?
- Were any interpretations unintended?
- What guidance should be refined for future communications?

Capture learning to improve future public-facing practice.

---

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- issue public statements with clarity and integrity  
- avoid AI-driven dilution of accountability  
- maintain trust through responsible communication  
- strengthen governance of institutional voice  
- build mature AI capability in public communication contexts
