# Professional Identity, Capability, and Role Evolution — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on professional identity, role evolution, and capability formation in AI-mediated work.

As AI becomes embedded across knowledge-intensive roles, the most profound impacts are not technical but **identity-shaping**. Professionals are being asked — often implicitly — to renegotiate expertise, responsibility, confidence, and value.

These scenarios address that deeper layer: how people make sense of *who they are becoming* when AI is present in their work.

---

## Why this scenario set matters

Most AI guidance focuses on *what people should do*.

This set focuses on **who people are becoming**.

This is where:
- professional judgement is diluted or clarified  
- confidence and legitimacy are quietly reshaped  
- anxiety, loss, and resistance surface  
- accountability is renegotiated  

These dynamics are rarely addressed explicitly — yet they shape every other domain of AI capability.

---

## Who this set is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Experienced professionals navigating AI-augmented roles  
- Senior academics, researchers, and professional staff  
- CPD facilitators and leadership development programmes  
- Line managers supporting role change and capability growth  
- Organisations seeking sustainable, humane AI adoption  

They are particularly suited to **mid-career and senior audiences**, where identity and responsibility are most at stake.

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Reflective, facilitation-ready guides  
- Grounded in real professional tensions and lived experience  
- Explicitly aligned to all six AI Capability Framework domains  
- Designed to surface judgement, uncertainty, and values  

### These scenarios are not:

- Change-management scripts  
- Productivity optimisation frameworks  
- Skills taxonomies or role descriptions  
- Psychological or therapeutic interventions  

They sit **between capability development, ethics, and professional practice**.

## How to use this set

A recommended approach:

1. Use scenarios as reflective prompts, not problem-solving exercises  
2. Read and discuss collectively in trusted settings  
3. Move deliberately through the Framework domains  
4. Allow discomfort, ambiguity, and disagreement  
5. Capture insights about boundaries, responsibility, and identity  
6. Revisit scenarios as roles and expectations evolve  

These scenarios work particularly well in:
- senior CPD and leadership programmes  
- facilitated retreats and awaydays  
- professional learning communities  
- reflective supervision or mentoring contexts

## Framework reference

All scenarios apply the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)**:

1. Awareness  
2. Human–AI Co-Agency  
3. Applied Practice  
4. Ethics, Equity & Impact  
5. Decision-Making & Governance

## Relationship to other scenario folders

This set complements:

- **Leadership and strategy** (direction and responsibility)  
- **Governance and decision-making** (formal accountability)  
- **CPD and capability development** (skills and confidence)  

It focuses specifically on **identity, meaning, and professional legitimacy** — the layer beneath roles, processes, and systems.
