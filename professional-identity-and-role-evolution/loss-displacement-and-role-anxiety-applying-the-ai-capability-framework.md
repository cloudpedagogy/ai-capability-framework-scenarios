# Loss, Displacement, and Role Anxiety: Applying the AI Capability Framework

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports professionals experiencing **anxiety, uncertainty, or loss** related to AI-driven change — including fears of redundancy, role erosion, de-skilling, or diminished professional identity.

As AI becomes more visible in organisational narratives, professionals may experience:
- concern that their expertise is being devalued
- uncertainty about long-term role viability
- pressure to adapt faster than feels reasonable
- emotional responses that are rarely acknowledged in formal AI guidance

This scenario reframes these experiences as **legitimate signals** rather than resistance, and supports reflective, humane engagement with AI-mediated change.

It is designed to support:
- Individuals navigating role uncertainty or transition  
- Professionals experiencing anxiety about AI and automation  
- Leaders and managers supporting teams through AI change  
- CPD, wellbeing, and reflective professional development contexts

## 2. Situation & Context

You are encountering AI-related change that affects how you see your role or future. This may involve:
- automation of tasks you previously owned
- organisational messaging about efficiency or transformation
- colleagues adopting AI faster or more visibly
- ambiguous signals about future skills or structures

Common experiences include:
- loss of confidence or professional identity
- fear of becoming obsolete
- tension between adaptation and resistance
- silence, because these concerns feel unsafe to voice

This scenario treats role anxiety as a **human response to structural change**, not a failure of adaptability.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be present:
- as a replacement narrative (“AI can now do X”)
- as a performance comparison point
- as a benchmark for future roles
- as a driver of organisational restructuring

These uses matter because:
- AI narratives often simplify complex work
- emotional labour and judgement are undervalued
- invisible work becomes easier to erase
- people experience loss before clarity

The risk is not AI itself, but **how change is framed and enacted**.

---

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Begin by acknowledging:
- what feels at risk
- what has changed materially
- what is being assumed rather than stated

Key awareness questions:
- What aspects of my role feel threatened?
- What am I grieving or anxious about?
- What is unclear or unresolved?

Awareness includes emotional reality, not just technical facts.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In contexts of displacement:
- humans retain agency over meaning and value
- AI does not replace accountability, care, or judgement
- co-agency must be negotiated, not imposed

Healthy co-agency involves:
- distinguishing tasks from roles
- recognising what AI cannot absorb
- reasserting professional responsibility

Avoid:
- internalising narratives of inevitability
- equating tool capability with role redundancy
- accepting loss without reflection or dialogue

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Constructive practices include:
- mapping which aspects of work are changing vs enduring
- identifying where judgement, ethics, or relationship remain central
- experimenting with bounded AI use rather than wholesale adoption

Harmful practices include:
- forced upskilling without support
- silent withdrawal or disengagement
- performative compliance masking distress

AI capability development must be **psychologically sustainable**.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Role displacement is an ethical issue.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Who bears the emotional cost of AI change?
- Whose work is rendered invisible?
- Are some groups disproportionately affected?

Ethical AI adoption:
- acknowledges loss as well as gain
- provides space for adaptation
- avoids framing anxiety as failure

Care and equity are capability concerns.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance of AI-driven change includes:
- transparency about role implications
- support structures for transition
- shared responsibility for adaptation

If AI is driving restructuring:
- decisions should be documented
- assumptions should be surfaced
- human impact should be considered explicitly

Governance fails when change is framed as purely technical.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Renewal does not mean erasing loss.

Reflect on:
- what aspects of your role still matter deeply
- what new forms of contribution may emerge
- what support you need to move forward

Renewal may involve:
- redefining expertise
- reshaping professional identity
- letting go of unsustainable expectations

Capability includes the capacity to **endure and adapt with integrity**.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What feels most uncertain right now?
- What parts of my work feel irreplaceable?
- Where do I need support rather than pressure?

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Help me map which parts of my role involve judgement or care.”
- “Identify skills that may evolve rather than disappear.”

**Pause & check**
- Am I being asked to adapt responsibly — or invisibly?
- Is this change humane as well as efficient?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

After periods of change:
- Were anxieties acknowledged or suppressed?
- Did adaptation feel supported?
- What narratives helped or harmed?

Capture learning to inform future change processes.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations and individuals:
- legitimise emotional responses to AI change
- avoid pathologising resistance or anxiety
- support humane, ethical transitions
- retain professional identity amid uncertainty
- build resilient, reflective AI capability cultures
