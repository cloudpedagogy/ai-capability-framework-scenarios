# Public Service, Policy, and Civic Decision-Making — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on public service, policy development, and civic decision-making contexts.

These scenarios address situations where AI use intersects directly with **public legitimacy, transparency, accountability, and trust**. Decisions in these contexts often affect citizens, communities, and democratic processes, making them among the highest-risk and highest-impact environments for AI use.

The scenarios are designed to support **responsible, defensible, and human-led decision-making** where AI may inform analysis, communication, or coordination — without undermining democratic values or public confidence.

---

## Why this scenario set matters

Public-sector and civic contexts present unique challenges for AI use:

- decisions often affect people who are not present in the room
- legitimacy depends on transparency and procedural fairness
- errors or opacity can trigger reputational, legal, or political consequences
- accountability cannot be delegated to tools or vendors

This scenario set extends the AI Capability Framework beyond internal governance to **decisions that directly affect the public**, complementing — but not duplicating — institutional governance scenarios.

---

## Who this set is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Policy professionals and civil servants
- Public-sector leaders and senior officials
- Regulatory and oversight bodies
- Local and national government teams
- Public engagement, consultation, and communications teams
- Advisors supporting public decision-making

They are suitable for:
- individual reflection
- team discussion
- policy development workshops
- governance and assurance processes
- leadership development and CPD

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:
- Facilitation-ready, realistic guides
- Explicitly aligned to all six AI Capability Framework domains
- Focused on legitimacy, transparency, and public trust
- Designed to surface ethical, civic, and accountability considerations
- Adaptable to different policy and jurisdictional contexts

### These scenarios are not:
- Policy templates or legal advice
- Technical AI system design guides
- Tools for automating public decisions
- Communication spin or reputation management playbooks

They are designed to sit **between policy and practice**, supporting judgement in complex, real-world civic situations.
