# Cross-Agency Coordination and AI Use: Applying the AI Capability Framework

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports situations where **multiple public bodies or agencies collaborate** on decisions, services, or interventions that involve AI-supported systems, shared data, or joint analytical tools.

Cross-agency coordination is increasingly necessary to address complex public challenges — such as health, welfare, safety, migration, environment, or infrastructure. AI is often introduced to enable scale, consistency, or insight across organisational boundaries. At the same time, this is where accountability, transparency, and governance are most fragile.

The purpose of this scenario is to help public organisations use AI collaboratively **without diluting responsibility, obscuring accountability, or undermining public trust**.

This scenario is designed to support:

- Cross-agency programme teams  
- Policy leads and senior responsible owners  
- Data-sharing and interoperability teams  
- Governance, legal, and assurance functions  
- Public sector partnerships and consortia  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

Two or more agencies are working together on a shared initiative that may involve:

- pooled or linked datasets  
- shared AI models or analytics platforms  
- coordinated decision workflows  
- joint service delivery or enforcement  

Examples include:

- cross-departmental risk identification  
- integrated public service provision  
- joint regulatory or inspection regimes  
- regional or national data platforms  

In these contexts, AI can enable coordination — but also create ambiguity about **who is accountable for what**.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in cross-agency contexts to:

- integrate or analyse data from multiple sources  
- generate shared dashboards or risk indicators  
- support prioritisation or allocation across systems  
- harmonise decision criteria  

These uses matter because:

- accountability can become diffused  
- assumptions embedded by one agency may affect others  
- governance standards may differ  
- errors can propagate across systems  

This scenario treats AI use in cross-agency coordination as **high-impact and governance-critical**.

---

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before deploying or sharing AI-enabled systems, agencies should clarify:

- the shared purpose and public interest justification  
- where authority and responsibility sit  
- what assumptions are being standardised  

Key awareness questions:

- What problem are we solving together — and why?  
- Where might local context be lost?  
- What risks arise from coordination itself?  

AI should enable collaboration without flattening accountability.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In cross-agency settings:

- humans retain responsibility within their organisational remit  
- AI may support coordination, not substitute governance  
- no agency should defer responsibility to “the system”  

Good co-agency means:

- clear ownership of AI components  
- explicit decision rights and escalation routes  
- shared understanding of system limitations  

Avoid:

- assuming shared tools imply shared accountability  
- delegating judgement to joint dashboards  
- blurring lines of responsibility across agencies  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:

- supporting shared situational awareness  
- highlighting cross-cutting risks or trends  
- enabling coordination while preserving discretion  

Inappropriate uses include:

- enforcing uniform decisions without local judgement  
- automating inter-agency decisions  
- masking disagreement through aggregate outputs  

AI should support coordination **without erasing difference**.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Cross-agency AI use can amplify impact.

Use the Framework to ask:

- Do combined datasets increase surveillance or exclusion risk?  
- Are impacts unevenly distributed across populations?  
- Could coordination reduce individuals’ ability to challenge decisions?  

Ethical coordination requires heightened attention to cumulative effects.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Strong governance in cross-agency AI use includes:

- formal agreements on roles, data use, and accountability  
- aligned but not identical governance standards  
- clear audit and review mechanisms  

If AI is used:

- document decision flows across agencies  
- ensure appeal and redress routes remain clear  
- avoid “black box” coordination platforms  

This protects legitimacy and democratic oversight.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After joint initiatives, reflect:

- Did coordination improve outcomes or introduce new risks?  
- Where did accountability feel unclear?  
- What governance adaptations are needed?  

Learning should inform future collaboration, not just system optimisation.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**

- Who is accountable for this decision at each stage?  
- Where might coordination be masking disagreement?  
- What would transparency look like to the public?  

**Optional AI prompts**

- “Map decision responsibilities across agencies.”  
- “Identify assumptions embedded across shared datasets.”  

**Pause & check**

- Would each agency defend this decision independently?  
- Is AI supporting coordination or obscuring responsibility?  

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following cross-agency use:

- Were roles and responsibilities clear in practice?  
- Did AI use support or strain trust between agencies?  
- What should change before scaling further?  

Use insights to strengthen collaborative governance.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:

- coordinate responsibly across institutional boundaries  
- preserve accountability in shared AI systems  
- anticipate cumulative ethical and governance risks  
- support transparent, defensible public decisions  
- build mature AI capability for complex civic challenges
