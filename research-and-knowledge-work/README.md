# Research and Knowledge Work — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on research, analysis, knowledge production, and scholarly communication.

These scenarios address moments where AI is increasingly present across the research lifecycle — from early planning and interpretation to grant writing, dissemination, and public communication. These are epistemically sensitive stages where choices about framing, methods, claims, and representation directly shape what counts as knowledge.

The scenarios support **responsible, reflective, and defensible use of AI** in research and knowledge work — without automation bias, over-claiming, or loss of methodological integrity.

---

## Who This Set Is For

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Researchers and scholars across disciplines  
- Research leads, supervisors, and principal investigators  
- Research development and pre-award teams  
- Knowledge exchange, policy, and communications professionals  
- Interdisciplinary and mixed-methods research teams  

They are suitable for individual reflection, team discussions, research planning meetings, and professional development contexts.

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios are:

- Practical, research-facing applications of the AI Capability Framework  
- Focused on real research and knowledge-work decisions  
- Explicitly mapped to all six framework domains  
- Designed to protect epistemic judgement, integrity, and trust  
- Usable across qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods contexts  

### These scenarios are not:

- Instructions to automate research workflows  
- Shortcuts for generating findings or claims  
- Endorsements of AI as an epistemic authority  
- Tools to bypass peer review, supervision, or ethical oversight

## Scenarios in This Folder

### `project-planning-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **project planning and early-stage research design**.

Focuses on:
- Using AI to explore options without locking plans prematurely  
- Surfacing assumptions, risks, and constraints  
- Maintaining human ownership of scope, methods, and intent  

---

### `analysis-and-interpretation-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **analysis and interpretation of data and evidence**.

Focuses on:
- Protecting interpretive judgement and epistemic humility  
- Avoiding overfitting, spurious pattern recognition, and automation bias  
- Treating AI outputs as exploratory artefacts, not conclusions  

---

### `grant-writing-meetings-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **collaborative grant writing and funding development**.

Focuses on:
- Maintaining intellectual ownership and authenticity  
- Avoiding over-claiming driven by AI-generated language  
- Aligning proposals with funder intent, feasibility, and ethics  

---

### `dissemination-and-communication-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **responsible dissemination and public communication** of research.

Focuses on:
- Retaining uncertainty and proportionality in communication  
- Adapting messages ethically across audiences  
- Protecting credibility, trust, and reputational integrity

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended approach:

1. Identify the research stage you are currently working in  
2. Read the relevant scenario before or during that stage  
3. Engage with the reflection prompts individually or as a team  
4. Use AI selectively to support exploration, drafting, or comparison  
5. Document judgements, assumptions, and boundaries  
6. Revisit scenarios as projects evolve  

Scenarios may be used independently or combined to support **end-to-end research practice**.

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

This folder focuses on **knowledge production and interpretation**.

Related but distinct folders include:

- **Leadership and Strategy**  
  Covers strategic direction, prioritisation, and organisational foresight.

- **Governance and Decision-Making**  
  Addresses approval, risk, ethics panels, and formal accountability.

- **Teaching and Facilitation**  
  Focuses on learning design and educational contexts rather than research.

- **Meetings and Collaboration**  
  Covers collaborative process rather than epistemic work itself.

The separation ensures clarity between **how knowledge is produced**, **how decisions are governed**, and **how learning is designed**.
