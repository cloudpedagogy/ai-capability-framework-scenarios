# Grant Writing Meetings: Applying the AI Capability Framework

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports grant writing meetings where research teams collaboratively shape funding proposals, align narratives, and make strategic decisions about scope, positioning, and claims. These meetings are high-pressure, competitive, and consequential — success can determine whether research proceeds at all.

AI is increasingly introduced into grant writing to draft sections, refine language, benchmark against successful bids, or summarise funder priorities. While these uses can improve efficiency and clarity, they also risk over-standardisation, exaggerated claims, or misalignment with funder intent if AI outputs are treated as authoritative.

The purpose of this scenario is to help teams use AI as a bounded writing and sensemaking aid, while ensuring that intellectual ownership, methodological integrity, and ethical responsibility remain firmly human.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Principal investigators and co-investigators  
- Research development and pre-award teams  
- Interdisciplinary grant-writing groups  
- Professional services staff supporting bids  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

A grant writing meeting is convened to:
- shape or refine a funding proposal  
- align contributions across disciplines  
- respond to specific funder calls and criteria  
- agree claims, scope, and responsibilities  

These meetings often involve:
- tight deadlines and limited iterations  
- uneven familiarity with funder language  
- tension between ambition and feasibility  

AI may be used to draft text, analyse call documents, or compare bids. How it is used will shape whether the proposal is authentic, credible, and ethically sound.

---

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in grant writing meetings to:
- summarise call requirements and evaluation criteria  
- draft or refine sections of the proposal  
- suggest impact statements or narratives  
- benchmark language against successful applications  

These uses matter because:
- AI-generated text can drift toward generic phrasing  
- benchmarking may encourage conformity over fit  
- persuasive language can unintentionally overclaim  

This scenario treats AI use in grant writing as **medium- to high-risk**, particularly where claims, impact, and ethics are involved.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, teams should clarify:
- the funder’s intent and values  
- the proposal’s core intellectual contribution  
- what claims can be genuinely supported  

Key awareness questions:
- What is distinctive about this proposal?  
- Where must we be precise rather than persuasive?  
- What assumptions might AI introduce into our narrative?  

AI should be used to support clarity, not to inflate ambition.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In grant writing contexts:
- humans remain authors and owners of ideas  
- AI may assist with drafting, editing, and comparison  

Good co-agency means:
- AI outputs are treated as drafts or prompts  
- investigators review and validate all claims  
- responsibility for content is explicitly human  

Avoid:
- submitting AI-generated text without scrutiny  
- allowing AI to shape research direction implicitly  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- drafting alternative phrasings for discussion  
- checking alignment with call language  
- identifying gaps or inconsistencies across sections  

Inappropriate uses include:
- generating research questions or methods without deliberation  
- producing impact claims not grounded in evidence  
- masking uncertainty to improve competitiveness  

AI should support collaborative authorship, not shortcut it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Grant writing has ethical implications.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Are proposed impacts realistic and responsible?  
- Does the narrative privilege certain voices or contexts?  
- Could AI use reinforce inequities in access or representation?  

Ethical grant writing requires honesty, inclusion, and care in representation.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:
- clear ownership of proposal sections and claims  
- documentation of key decisions and assumptions  
- alignment with institutional and funder policies  

If AI is used:
- record its role in drafting or analysis  
- ensure compliance with funder rules on AI use  
- retain human oversight and sign-off  

This supports integrity and defensibility.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After submission, reflect:
- Did AI use improve coherence or dilute voice?  
- Where did the process feel rushed or constrained?  
- What should change in future bids?  

Reflection builds long-term grant-writing capability, not just one-off success.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What claims are we most confident defending?  
- Where might reviewers push back?  
- Are we balancing ambition with feasibility?  

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Rewrite this section to improve clarity without increasing claims.”  
- “Identify areas where evidence is thin or assumptions are implicit.”  

**Pause & check**
- Are we comfortable owning every sentence of this proposal?  
- Would we explain this narrative openly to peers or participants?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following grant submission:
- How did AI use affect team collaboration?  
- Did the proposal reflect our genuine intent?  
- What feedback should inform future bids?  

Capture learning to strengthen future grant development.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- write stronger, more authentic grant proposals  
- avoid over-claiming driven by AI-generated language  
- align bids with funder intent and ethical standards  
- strengthen collaborative authorship practices  
- build mature AI capability in competitive research contexts
