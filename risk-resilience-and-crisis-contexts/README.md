# Risk, Resilience, and Crisis Contexts — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on high-pressure, high-uncertainty contexts where decisions must be made quickly, information is incomplete, and consequences are reputationally and operationally significant.

These scenarios address moments where AI behaves differently — and more dangerously — than in stable conditions. Under pressure, AI outputs can feel authoritative, compress deliberation, and encourage premature certainty. This scenario set is designed to help organisations use AI to **support resilience rather than amplify risk**.

---

## Why This Scenario Set Matters

Risk and crisis contexts expose the weakest points of AI use:

- time pressure reduces critical scrutiny  
- incomplete or fast-changing data increases error  
- reputational stakes magnify harm  
- accountability can fracture under urgency  

This folder focuses on **judgement under pressure**, helping teams remain deliberate, ethical, and defensible even when conditions are unstable.

---

## Who This Set Is For

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Senior leaders and executive teams  
- Risk, resilience, and business continuity leads  
- Crisis response and incident management teams  
- Communications and public affairs professionals  
- Governance, assurance, and audit functions  

They are particularly suited to **tabletop exercises, simulations, and senior-level training**.

---

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios are:

- High-stakes, facilitation-ready guides  
- Grounded in realistic risk and crisis situations  
- Explicitly aligned to all six domains of the AI Capability Framework  
- Designed to surface judgement, trade-offs, and accountability  
- Applicable across sectors (education, research, public service, healthcare, infrastructure)

### These scenarios are not:

- Emergency response manuals  
- Technical incident runbooks  
- AI optimisation or automation guides  
- Substitutes for professional crisis leadership  

They sit **between policy and action**, supporting reflective decision-making when pressure is highest.

## Scenarios in This Folder

This folder contains the following scenarios:

- **Incident Response and AI Use**  
- **Crisis Communications and AI Drafting**  
- **Reputational Risk Assessment**  
- **Business Continuity and Scenario Stress-Testing**  
- **Post-Incident Review and Learning**

Each scenario applies the AI Capability Framework to a distinct phase of risk and crisis management.

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended approach:

1. Select a scenario relevant to your current risk or preparedness context  
2. Use it as a tabletop or facilitated discussion  
3. Work through the six framework domains deliberately  
4. Surface assumptions, limits, and decision boundaries  
5. Capture learning for future resilience planning  

These scenarios are particularly effective when used **before a crisis**, not only after one.

---

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

This folder complements but does not duplicate:

- **Leadership and Strategy** — long-term direction and prioritisation  
- **Governance and Decision-Making** — formal accountability and approval  
- **Public Service and Civic Decision-Making** — public-facing legitimacy  

This set focuses specifically on **compressed decision-making under uncertainty**.
