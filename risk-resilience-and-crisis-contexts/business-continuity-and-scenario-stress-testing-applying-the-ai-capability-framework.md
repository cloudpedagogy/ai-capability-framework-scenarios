# Business Continuity and Scenario Stress-Testing: Applying the AI Capability Framework

Framework: CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)  
Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports business continuity planning and scenario stress-testing activities where organisations prepare for disruption, failure, or unexpected change. These activities are designed to protect critical functions, minimise harm, and sustain operations under adverse conditions.

AI is increasingly introduced into continuity planning to generate scenarios, model cascading impacts, simulate recovery timelines, or prioritise risks. While these uses can expand the range of possibilities considered, they also risk producing false coherence, overconfidence in models, or an illusion of preparedness if treated as predictive or authoritative.

The purpose of this scenario is to help teams use AI, if at all, as a **provocation and exploration tool**, while ensuring that resilience planning remains grounded in human judgement, organisational knowledge, and ethical responsibility.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Business continuity and resilience leads  
- Risk and assurance teams  
- Senior leaders and executive committees  
- Operational managers and service owners  
- Governance, compliance, and audit functions

## 2. Situation & Context

An organisation is undertaking continuity planning or stress-testing in response to:
- regulatory or assurance requirements  
- recent incidents or near misses  
- emerging technological, geopolitical, or environmental risks  
- strategic planning or organisational change  

At this stage:
- scenarios are hypothetical but consequential  
- assumptions about capacity and resilience are tested  
- uncomfortable vulnerabilities may surface  

AI may be proposed to:
- generate plausible disruption scenarios  
- model knock-on effects across systems or services  
- estimate recovery timelines or resource strain  
- compare organisational readiness against benchmarks  

How AI is used will shape whether planning strengthens resilience — or merely produces documentation.

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in continuity and stress-testing to:
- generate multiple disruption scenarios rapidly  
- explore dependencies and cascading failures  
- summarise vulnerabilities across complex systems  
- support tabletop exercises with simulated inputs  

These uses matter because:
- generated scenarios may feel comprehensive but miss context-specific risks  
- simulations can obscure uncertainty and improvisation  
- modelled timelines may imply feasibility without evidence  

This scenario treats AI use in continuity planning as **medium-risk but high-leverage**, requiring explicit framing and scepticism.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI in continuity planning, teams should clarify:
- what types of disruption are most relevant to their context  
- which assumptions are being tested versus accepted  
- what “resilience” means beyond recovery time  

Key awareness questions:
- Are we exploring uncertainty or seeking reassurance?
- What failures would be hardest to imagine or admit?
- Where might AI default to generic scenarios?

AI should be used to **expand thinking**, not to close it.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In continuity and stress-testing:
- humans remain responsible for interpreting readiness and risk  
- AI may assist with scenario generation, not evaluation  

Good co-agency means:
- teams define stress-testing objectives before using AI  
- AI-generated scenarios are interrogated and adapted  
- ownership of preparedness decisions is explicit  

Avoid:
- treating AI-generated scenarios as exhaustive  
- deferring resilience judgements to models  
- confusing documentation with capability  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- generating contrasting scenarios to provoke discussion  
- stress-testing assumptions about dependencies  
- supporting facilitation of tabletop exercises  

Inappropriate uses include:
- claiming preparedness based on simulated outputs  
- ranking risks without contextual judgement  
- replacing lived organisational knowledge with abstraction  

AI should support **learning-oriented stress**, not false confidence.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Disruptions affect people unevenly.
Use the Framework to ask:
- Who bears the greatest harm during disruption?
- Are continuity plans privileging institutional survival over care?
- Could AI-generated scenarios ignore vulnerable groups?

Ethical resilience planning considers impact, not just recovery.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Strong governance of continuity planning includes:
- clear accountability for resilience decisions  
- documentation of assumptions and limits  
- regular review and testing of plans  

If AI is used:
- record where it informed scenario design  
- avoid presenting AI outputs as assurance evidence  
- ensure findings are contestable and revisitable  

This supports credible assurance and auditability.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After stress-testing exercises, reflect:
- What assumptions were challenged?
- Where did AI help surface blind spots?
- What capabilities need strengthening?

Reflection transforms planning into resilience.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What would actually fail first in this scenario?
- Where are we relying on goodwill or improvisation?
- What is not captured in this model?

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Generate a disruption scenario that challenges our strongest assumptions.”
- “Identify dependencies that are often overlooked.”

**Pause & check**
- Are we mistaking complexity for preparedness?
- Is AI helping us learn, or reassuring us prematurely?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following continuity planning:
- Did scenarios meaningfully influence decisions?
- Were vulnerabilities acknowledged or minimised?
- How should plans and exercises evolve?

Feed learning into governance, investment, and capability development.

---

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- use AI to enrich resilience planning responsibly
- avoid overconfidence driven by simulated certainty
- surface ethical and equity considerations in disruption
- strengthen governance of continuity and assurance
- build adaptive, learning-oriented resilience capability
