# Crisis Communications and AI Drafting: Applying the AI Capability Framework

Framework: CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)  
Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports crisis communication situations where organisations must communicate quickly, accurately, and credibly during incidents that carry reputational, regulatory, safety, or public trust implications.

AI is increasingly introduced into crisis communications to draft statements, refine messaging, summarise facts, tailor updates for different audiences, or maintain message consistency under pressure. While these uses can support speed and coordination, they also carry serious risks: misrepresentation, loss of nuance, premature certainty, tone misalignment, and erosion of accountability for public-facing claims.

The purpose of this scenario is to help teams use AI, if at all, as a **bounded drafting and coordination aid**, while ensuring that truthfulness, proportionality, care, and responsibility remain firmly human-led.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Communications and public affairs teams  
- Senior leaders and executive spokespersons  
- Risk, resilience, and incident response leads  
- Policy, legal, and regulatory liaison teams  
- Governance functions overseeing public accountability  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

An incident has occurred or is unfolding, and communication is required. Examples include:
- public notification of a data breach or service outage  
- regulatory reporting and public statements  
- media enquiries under tight deadlines  
- internal staff communications during uncertainty  

At this stage:
- facts may still be incomplete or evolving  
- legal, ethical, and reputational considerations intersect  
- pressure exists to reassure, explain, and demonstrate control  
- missteps in language can escalate harm or mistrust  

AI may be proposed to:
- draft holding statements or FAQs  
- summarise known facts for communication teams  
- adapt messages for different audiences  
- support consistency across channels  

How AI is used — and constrained — will directly shape trust, credibility, and downstream scrutiny.

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in crisis communications to:
- draft initial statements under time pressure  
- standardise language across updates  
- simplify technical information for public audiences  
- generate alternative phrasings for review  

These uses matter because:
- drafted language can imply certainty where none exists  
- AI may default to overly confident or generic tones  
- simplification can unintentionally remove caveats  
- repetition can reinforce incorrect framing  

This scenario treats AI use in crisis communications as **high-reputational-risk**, requiring disciplined governance and human judgement.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI in crisis communication, teams should clarify:
- what is confirmed, provisional, or unknown  
- what audiences need now versus later  
- what must *not* be said prematurely  

Key awareness questions:
- Are we communicating facts, reassurance, or intent?
- What uncertainty must remain visible?
- Where could AI wording overstate confidence?

AI should be used to **support clarity**, not to manufacture certainty.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In crisis communications:
- humans retain full authorship and accountability  
- AI may assist with drafting, not deciding  

Good co-agency means:
- humans define messaging intent and boundaries  
- AI outputs are reviewed line-by-line  
- final wording is explicitly human-approved  

Avoid:
- publishing AI-generated text without validation  
- allowing AI to shape narrative direction implicitly  
- treating stylistic polish as accuracy  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- generating multiple draft phrasings for discussion  
- checking consistency across statements  
- organising known facts into clear structures  

Inappropriate uses include:
- drafting external statements without senior sign-off  
- rephrasing uncertainty into confidence  
- optimising language for reassurance over truth  

AI should support **responsible drafting**, not reputational spin.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Crisis communication affects different groups unevenly.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Who may be harmed by this wording?
- Are some audiences more vulnerable or affected?
- Does this communication centre organisational comfort over public understanding?

Ethical communication prioritises honesty, care, and proportionality.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Strong governance in crisis communications includes:
- clear approval pathways and spokesperson authority  
- separation of drafting from decision accountability  
- documentation of communication rationale  

If AI is used:
- record its role in drafting or revision  
- ensure traceability of final wording  
- avoid opaque content-generation pipelines  

This supports defensibility and post-incident review.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After communications are issued, reflect:
- Did AI use improve clarity or introduce risk?
- Where did tone or framing cause concern?
- What boundaries should be reinforced next time?

Reflection strengthens communication capability under pressure.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What are we absolutely sure of right now?
- What could this wording be misread as?
- Who might feel excluded, blamed, or misled?

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Rewrite this statement to retain uncertainty explicitly.”
- “Identify phrases that imply certainty or resolution.”

**Pause & check**
- Would we defend this wording publicly later?
- Are we communicating responsibly, not just quickly?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following crisis communications:
- How were messages received by different audiences?
- Did AI use reduce or increase risk?
- What governance gaps became visible?

Capture learning to strengthen future crisis readiness.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- communicate credibly during high-pressure incidents
- avoid AI-driven overconfidence or misrepresentation
- protect trust, legitimacy, and accountability
- strengthen governance of public-facing AI use
- build resilient, human-centred communication practices
