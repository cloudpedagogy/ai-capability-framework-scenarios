# Student Support and Advising — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on student support, advising, and pastoral contexts.

These scenarios address situations where AI may be present in **care-adjacent, trust-based interactions** with students — including advising conversations, personal tutoring, guidance systems, and moments of vulnerability or escalation.

Student support contexts are among the **most ethically sensitive and reputationally high-risk areas** for AI use. Decisions made here affect wellbeing, trust, equity, and institutional duty of care. As such, these scenarios prioritise **human judgement, clear boundaries, and responsible escalation** over efficiency or automation.

## Who this set is for

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Academic advisors and personal tutors  
- Student support and wellbeing staff  
- Programme leaders and student experience teams  
- Professional services staff involved in advising or guidance  
- Educational leaders responsible for student-facing AI use  
- Institutions developing AI-aware student support practices  

---

## What these scenarios are (and are not)

### These scenarios are:

- Structured, facilitation-ready guides  
- Grounded in realistic student-facing contexts  
- Explicitly aligned to all six domains of the AI Capability Framework  
- Designed for reflective practice, team discussion, and policy-adjacent use  
- Suitable for education, research-intensive, and public-sector institutions  

### These scenarios are not:

- Automated advising or chatbot design guides  
- Mental health diagnostic tools or interventions  
- Replacements for professional judgement or safeguarding processes  
- Technical AI system specifications  
- Policy or compliance documents  

They are intended to sit **between policy and practice**, supporting staff to make **defensible, humane decisions** where AI may influence student support interactions.

## Why this scenario set matters

AI is increasingly present — formally or informally — in student support contexts, including:

- advising and progression discussions  
- personalised guidance and recommendation systems  
- early warning and engagement monitoring  
- drafting or summarising student communications  

At the same time, institutions are often **least prepared** to govern AI use in these spaces.

This scenario set responds to that gap by:

- surfacing ethical, equity, and care considerations early  
- reinforcing boundaries around responsibility and escalation  
- supporting staff confidence in saying *when AI should not be used*  
- aligning student support practice with institutional duty of care

## Scenarios in this folder

This folder contains the following scenarios:

- **Academic Advising Conversations**  
- **Personal Tutoring and Progress Review**  
- **AI-Supported Guidance Systems**  
- **Supporting Students in Distress**  
- **Escalation and Safeguarding Boundaries**

Each scenario focuses on a distinct risk profile and decision threshold, from routine advising through to high-stakes pastoral and safeguarding situations.

## How to use this set

A recommended approach:

1. Select the scenario most aligned to your student support context  
2. Read the situation and risk framing carefully  
3. Work through the six Framework domains collaboratively  
4. Use AI selectively to support reflection or organisation — not judgement  
5. Make boundaries, responsibilities, and escalation routes explicit  
6. Capture learning and adapt practices over time  

These scenarios can be used:

- in staff development and CPD  
- in advising and tutoring training  
- in governance and risk discussions  
- as design scaffolds for student-facing AI systems  

---

## Framework reference

All scenarios apply the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** across six domains:

1. **Awareness**  
2. **Human–AI Co-Agency**  
3. **Applied Practice**  
4. **Ethics, Equity & Impact**  
5. **Decision-Making & Governance**  
6. **Reflection, Learning & Renewal**

The Framework is treated as the **canonical reference model**, with scenarios demonstrating how it operates in sensitive, real-world contexts.
