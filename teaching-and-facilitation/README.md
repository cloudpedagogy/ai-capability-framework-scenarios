# Teaching and Facilitation — Scenario Set

This folder contains scenario-based applications of the **CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition)** focused on teaching, facilitation, and professional learning contexts.

These scenarios address moments where AI is increasingly present in learning design, classroom practice, facilitation, and staff development. They focus on protecting pedagogical judgement, learner trust, and educational integrity while enabling thoughtful, reflective use of AI in real teaching situations.

The emphasis is not on tools, but on **how educators think, decide, and act** when AI is available, constrained, or deliberately excluded.

---

## Who This Set Is For

These scenarios are designed to support:

- Academic staff and tutors  
- Learning designers and educational developers  
- CPD facilitators and trainers  
- Programme leaders and teaching teams  
- Staff supporting academic practice and enhancement  

They are suitable for individual reflection, teaching team discussions, curriculum workshops, and professional development activities.

## What These Scenarios Are (and Are Not)

### These scenarios are:

- Pedagogically grounded applications of the AI Capability Framework  
- Focused on real teaching and facilitation decisions  
- Explicitly mapped to all six framework domains  
- Designed to surface judgement, ethics, and inclusion  
- Usable across disciplines and delivery modes  

### These scenarios are not:

- Prescriptive teaching recipes or tool guides  
- Automation strategies for content or assessment  
- Generic “best practice” checklists  
- Substitutes for pedagogical expertise or reflective teaching

## Scenarios in This Folder

### `student-facing-activities-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports the **design and delivery of student-facing learning activities**.

Focuses on:
- Making AI use explicit and pedagogically intentional  
- Protecting academic integrity and learner trust  
- Designing tasks that foreground process, judgement, and learning  

---

### `curriculum-design-workshops-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **collaborative curriculum design and review workshops**.

Focuses on:
- Using AI to support exploration without flattening debate  
- Maintaining disciplinary and pedagogical judgement  
- Designing inclusive, coherent, and future-facing curricula  

---

### `cpd-and-training-sessions-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **continuing professional development and staff training**.

Focuses on:
- Building genuine AI capability rather than tool fluency  
- Avoiding over-scaffolded or performative learning  
- Modelling responsible, critical AI use for participants  

---

### `reflective-debriefs-applying-the-ai-capability-framework.md`
Supports **structured reflective debriefs after teaching or facilitation activities**.

Focuses on:
- Surfacing judgement, assumptions, and ethical considerations  
- Making learning about AI use (and non-use) explicit  
- Feeding reflection back into teaching design and practice  

---

## How to Use This Scenario Set

A recommended approach:

1. Identify the teaching or facilitation context you are working in  
2. Read the relevant scenario before design or delivery  
3. Use the reflection prompts individually or with colleagues  
4. Introduce AI selectively and transparently where appropriate  
5. Capture learning and adapt future practice  

Scenarios can be used standalone or combined with **template resources** (such as briefs, prompt cards, and reflections) to support facilitation.

## Relationship to Other Scenario Folders

This folder focuses on **educational practice and learning design**.

Related folders include:

- **Education**  
  Contains reusable templates, checklists, and design tools for curriculum, assessment, and student guidance.

- **Meetings and Collaboration**  
  Covers facilitation and decision-making processes beyond teaching contexts.

- **Research and Knowledge Work**  
  Addresses research design, analysis, and dissemination rather than learning.

- **Governance and Decision-Making**  
  Focuses on approval, policy, and formal oversight rather than pedagogy.

This separation helps maintain clarity between **teaching practice**, **educational governance**, and **institutional decision-making**.
