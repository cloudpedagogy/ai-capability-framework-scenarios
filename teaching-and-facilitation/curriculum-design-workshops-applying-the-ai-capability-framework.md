## 1. Purpose of This Scenario

This scenario supports curriculum design workshops where educators, learning designers, and stakeholders collaboratively design, revise, or align modules and programmes. These workshops are pivotal moments where educational intent, disciplinary values, institutional priorities, and learner needs are negotiated.

AI is increasingly introduced into curriculum workshops to generate learning outcomes, suggest activities, map curricula, or visualise programme structures. While these uses can accelerate ideation and surface patterns, they also risk flattening pedagogical debate, importing generic designs, or privileging efficiency over educational purpose.

The purpose of this scenario is to help participants use AI as a co-design and sensemaking aid, while ensuring that pedagogical judgement, disciplinary expertise, and educational values remain explicitly human.

This scenario is designed to support:
- Academic staff and programme leaders  
- Learning designers and educational developers  
- Curriculum review panels and committees  
- External partners involved in curriculum co-design  

---

## 2. Situation & Context

A curriculum design workshop is convened to:
- design a new module or programme  
- revise curriculum in response to review or strategic change  
- improve coherence, progression, or inclusivity  
- integrate future-facing skills, technologies, or priorities  

These workshops often involve:
- diverse disciplinary perspectives  
- competing views of educational quality  
- pressure to innovate while meeting regulatory standards  

AI may be used to draft content, map learning outcomes, or visualise curriculum structures. How it is used will shape whether the workshop enables deep pedagogical thinking or converges prematurely on generic solutions.

## 3. Where AI Might Be Used (and Why That Matters)

AI may be used in curriculum design workshops to:
- generate or refine learning outcomes  
- suggest assessment or learning activity ideas  
- map curriculum coherence and progression  
- surface gaps, duplication, or misalignment  

These uses matter because:
- AI-generated outcomes may reflect dominant educational norms  
- suggested activities can privilege particular learner profiles  
- visualisations can imply coherence where debate is still needed  

This scenario treats AI use in curriculum design as **medium-risk but pedagogically sensitive**, requiring careful facilitation and framing.

## 4. Applying the AI Capability Framework

### 4.1 Awareness

Before using AI, participants should clarify:
- the educational purpose of the curriculum  
- whose learning needs are being prioritised  
- what constraints are fixed versus negotiable  

Key awareness questions:
- What kind of learning experience are we designing for?  
- Where is pedagogical disagreement healthy and necessary?  
- What assumptions might AI embed by default?  

AI should be used to support exploration, not to shortcut educational judgement.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

In curriculum workshops:
- humans define educational intent, values, and success criteria  
- AI may assist with ideation, drafting, and mapping  

Good co-agency means:
- AI outputs are treated as provisional prompts  
- educators actively critique and adapt suggestions  
- disciplinary and contextual expertise guide decisions  

Avoid:
- accepting AI-generated designs uncritically  
- delegating curriculum authorship to tools  

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice

Appropriate AI uses include:
- generating multiple outcome or activity options for discussion  
- visualising curriculum structures to support collective sensemaking  
- identifying potential misalignment or gaps for review  

Inappropriate uses include:
- finalising curricula automatically  
- standardising design across contexts without scrutiny  
- replacing collaborative discussion with AI outputs  

AI should support collaboration and reflection, not replace them.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Curriculum design has long-term equity implications.

Use the Framework to ask:
- Who is included or excluded by this curriculum?  
- Do proposed designs privilege certain backgrounds or abilities?  
- Could AI use reinforce dominant pedagogical models?  

Ethical curriculum design requires intentional attention to inclusion and impact.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Good governance practices include:
- clarity about approval authority and processes  
- documentation of design rationales and assumptions  
- alignment with institutional and regulatory requirements  

If AI is used:
- record its role in design discussions  
- ensure final approval remains human-led  
- avoid opaque curriculum development processes  

This supports transparency and quality assurance.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

After curriculum workshops, reflect:
- Did AI use enrich or constrain pedagogical thinking?  
- Where did debate deepen understanding?  
- How should future workshops be designed?  

Reflection strengthens curriculum design capability over time.

---

## 5. In-the-Moment Prompts & Checks

**Human reflection prompts**
- What kind of learner experience are we privileging?  
- Where are we compromising — and why?  
- What voices are missing from this room?  

**Optional AI prompts**
- “Generate alternative learning outcome framings that emphasise different pedagogical priorities.”  
- “Map these learning outcomes against assessments to identify misalignment.”  

**Pause & check**
- Are we designing for our learners or for convenience?  
- Is AI helping us think more deeply about learning?

---

## 6. After-Action Reflection

Following curriculum workshops:
- Were design decisions clearly documented?  
- Did AI use influence convergence or creativity?  
- What capability gaps were revealed?  

Feed learning into future curriculum development cycles.

## 7. What This Scenario Delivers

This scenario helps organisations:
- design curricula more deliberately and inclusively  
- use AI to support pedagogical exploration responsibly  
- avoid generic or context-blind curriculum design  
- strengthen governance and quality assurance  
- build mature, reflective AI capability in educational design contexts
