# Scenario Templates

This folder contains reusable templates designed to be used alongside any scenario in the **AI Capability Framework Scenario Library**.

The templates are intentionally short, facilitation-friendly, and context-agnostic. They help teams move from *reading scenarios* to *using them in practice*.

---

## How to use the templates

A simple workflow:

1. **Before an activity** → use the *Pre-Activity AI Brief*  
2. **During an activity** → draw on the *In-Activity Prompt Cards*  
3. **After an activity** → use the *Post-Activity Reflection*  
4. **Periodically** → use the *Capability Check-In*

## Ways the templates can be used

Templates can be:

- copied directly into agendas or slide decks  
- adapted to local policies, disciplines, and organisational cultures  
- combined with any scenario in this repository  

They are designed to be lightweight scaffolds rather than prescriptive instructions.

## Design principles

These templates are guided by the following principles:

- Human judgement remains central  
- AI use is explicit and bounded  
- Reflection and learning are prioritised  
- Alignment with the six AI Capability Framework domains is maintained
