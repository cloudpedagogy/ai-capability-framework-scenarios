## Purpose

This check-in provides a lightweight self, team, or group reflection aligned to the six domains of the AI Capability Framework.

It is designed to be used periodically — individually or collectively — to reflect on:
- confidence and comfort with AI use  
- emerging gaps or risks  
- how practice is evolving over time  

The check-in is not an assessment or compliance exercise. It is a reflective capability tool intended to support learning, dialogue, and improvement.

## Check-In Questions

### 1. Awareness
- Do we understand where AI is shaping our work?
- Are assumptions and limitations visible and discussed?

---

### 2. Human–AI Co-Agency
- Are roles between humans and AI clear?
- Is judgement remaining human-led?

---

### 3. Applied Practice
- Are we using AI in ways that genuinely support our goals?
- Are practices context-sensitive rather than generic?

---

### 4. Ethics, Equity & Impact
- Are ethical and equity considerations surfaced early?
- Do we feel confident raising concerns or questioning use?

---

### 5. Decision-Making & Governance
- Are responsibilities and approvals clear?
- Is AI use documented where appropriate?

---

### 6. Reflection, Learning & Renewal
- Are we learning from experience?
- Are practices evolving over time rather than staying fixed?

## Using This Check-In

This check-in can be used:
- at the start or end of a project or term  
- during team retrospectives or reviews  
- as a recurring monthly or quarterly reflection  
- to support facilitated discussion rather than scoring  

The aim is to surface insight, not to reach consensus.
