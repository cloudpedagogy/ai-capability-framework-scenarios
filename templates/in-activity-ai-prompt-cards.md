## Purpose

These prompt cards provide lightweight, optional prompt patterns that facilitators can use *during* an activity to keep AI use aligned with learning, judgement, and ethical awareness.

They are not instructions or requirements. Prompts should be used selectively, in response to what is happening in the room, rather than followed as a script.

The aim is to support sensemaking, critique, and reflection-in-action — not to accelerate output generation.

---

## Sensemaking Prompts

Use when discussion needs clarification without premature closure.

- “Summarise the key points, noting areas of disagreement or uncertainty.”
- “What assumptions might be influencing this output?”

---

## Challenge and Critique Prompts

Use when AI outputs appear confident, generic, or overly neat.

- “What does this output miss or oversimplify?”
- “Generate an alternative perspective or interpretation.”

---

## Ethics and Impact Prompts

Use when decisions, designs, or recommendations are emerging.

- “Who might be advantaged or disadvantaged by this approach?”
- “What risks or unintended consequences should we consider?”

---

## Reflection-in-Action Prompts

Use to slow down and surface judgement while the activity is still unfolding.

- “How is AI shaping our thinking right now?”
- “Are we deferring judgement too quickly?”

---

## Using These Prompt Cards

These prompts can be used:
- verbally by a facilitator  
- as slide inserts or printed cards  
- as optional on-screen prompts during AI-supported activities  

They are intended to *interrupt automation*, not to enforce it.
