# Post-Activity Reflection

## Purpose

This reflection supports consolidation of learning after an activity, focusing on both:

- the outcomes of the activity itself, and  
- how AI was used, constrained, or intentionally excluded.

It is designed to be used immediately after an activity or as part of a structured follow-up, helping participants and facilitators surface judgement, ethics, and capability development — not just task completion.

---

## Reflection Questions

### 1. Activity Outcomes

- What worked well?
- What was challenging or unclear?

---

### 2. Use of AI

- Where did AI help?
- Where did it hinder or distract?

---

### 3. Judgement and Decision-Making

- What decisions required human judgement?
- Where did we need to slow down, intervene, or override AI support?

---

### 4. Ethics and Impact

- Were there any equity, trust, or ethical concerns?
- How were they handled?

---

### 5. Learning Forward

- What should we do differently next time?
- What guidance, support, or capability needs strengthening?

---

## Using This Reflection

This reflection can be used:
- individually or in groups  
- verbally, in writing, or as a facilitated discussion  
- with or without AI support (e.g. clustering themes after reflection)

The aim is to strengthen learning, judgement, and ethical awareness — not to evaluate performance.
