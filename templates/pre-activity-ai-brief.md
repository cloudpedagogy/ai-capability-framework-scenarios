## Purpose

This brief sets clear, shared expectations for how AI will — and will not — be used in an upcoming activity.

It should be used at the start of meetings, workshops, teaching sessions, research activities, or collaborative work where AI may be present, permitted, constrained, or deliberately excluded.

The aim is to support clarity, trust, and responsible practice before work begins.

## 1. Purpose of the Activity

- What are we here to do?
- What decisions, learning, or outcomes matter most?

---

## 2. Role of AI in This Activity

### AI **will** be used to:

- ☐ support exploration or ideation  
- ☐ help organise or summarise information  
- ☐ prompt reflection or discussion  

### AI **will not** be used to:

- ☐ make decisions  
- ☐ replace professional or academic judgement  
- ☐ evaluate people or performance  

---

## 3. Boundaries and Expectations

- Responsibility for outcomes remains human  
- AI outputs are treated as provisional  
- Participants are encouraged to question and critique AI outputs  

---

## 4. Ethics and Care

- Be mindful of bias, power, and inclusion  
- Do not input sensitive or personal data  
- Raise concerns if AI use feels inappropriate  

---

## 5. Transparency

- If AI informs outputs or decisions, this will be made explicit

## Using This Brief

This brief can be:
- read aloud by a facilitator  
- shared as a slide or handout  
- adapted for different contexts (teaching, research, governance, CPD)

Its purpose is not restriction, but shared understanding and responsible use.
